    "content": "This view holds that for an individual to know a proposition, three criteria must be met: the proposition must be true, the individual must believe it, and the individual must have justification for that belief. Justification refers to having adequate reasons or evidence to support the belief in question, while truth signifies that the belief accurately reflects reality. This tripartite definition relies on the interplay between belief, truth, and justification, suggesting that knowledge is not merely about having true beliefs but also about the grounding of those beliefs in good reasons or proof. For any hypothetical case, if a person holds a belief that aligns with reality and can demonstrate valid justification for that belief, they would classify the case as knowledge.",

    "content": "This objection challenges the traditional view by presenting scenarios, known as \"Gettier cases,\" where individuals possess justified true beliefs that intuitively do not qualify as knowledge. For example, if a person has a justified belief based on misleading information that turns out to be true coincidentally, it raises the question of whether the justification was adequate. This undermines the tripartite definition by suggesting that even if the conditions of truth and justification are met, there may still be other aspects necessary for true knowledge that are not captured in the definition.",

It suggests that additional contextual factors, such as the social, historical, or situational contexts in which beliefs and justifications are situated, could play crucial roles in determining what constitutes knowledge.

Under this view, a belief counts as knowledge if it is obtained through a method that is dependable in producing true beliefs.

For example, if a reliable method is applied in a situation where its applicability is compromised or when environmental factors distort outcomes, the belief produced may still be false.
