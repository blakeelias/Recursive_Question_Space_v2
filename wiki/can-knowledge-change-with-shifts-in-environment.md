## Content

**Suppose a scientist believes she has internal justification for knowing that a particular plant species does not exist in the area.**, **Later, without any change in her internal state, an invasive species establishes itself locally. Intuitively, what she "knows" seems compromised, as knowledge depends on the external reality it tracks.**
