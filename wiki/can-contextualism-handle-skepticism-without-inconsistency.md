## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which the context has extremely high standards, requiring absolute certainty for justification to count as knowledge. Intuitively, in this context, almost no propositions can be known, which aligns with skepticism.**, **There is a plausible principle that contexts should not render practically everything unknowable, since knowledge is typically attainable. This principle suggests that high epistemic standards lead to implausible knowledge outcomes.**
