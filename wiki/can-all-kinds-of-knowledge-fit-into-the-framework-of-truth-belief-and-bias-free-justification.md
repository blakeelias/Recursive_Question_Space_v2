## Content

**Consider a scenario involving experiential or subjective knowledge, such as knowing how to ride a bike. Intuitively, this type of knowledge might not neatly fit into truth, belief, and bias-free justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that some forms of knowledge are more procedural or skill-based rather than propositional, challenging the idea that they can be reduced to truth, belief, and bias-free justification.**
