## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should have objective standards that do not vary across different situations.**, **Suppose a scenario in which the justification for a belief is considered sufficient in one context but insufficient in another.**, **Intuitively, if knowledge is context-dependent, the concept of an objective standard for knowledge becomes undermined, leading to a potential undercutting of what it means to truly "know" something.**
