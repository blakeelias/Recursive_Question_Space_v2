## Content

**A person uses a method they subjectively believe to be reliable, such as consulting a magic 8-ball, to determine the outcome of an event. The event occurs as predicted by the 8-ball. Although subjectively justified, the process lacks objective reliability, suggesting a gap in subjective justification and knowledge.**
