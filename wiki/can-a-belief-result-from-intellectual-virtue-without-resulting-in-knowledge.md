## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person arrives at a true belief through excellent reasoning abilities, judging correctly that it will rain tomorrow based on data analysis, but unknown to them, the prediction is true due to an unrelated coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively, this belief does not seem to constitute knowledge.**, **Suppose the same person, using their intellectual virtue, believes with confidence in today's reproduction of an experiment they performed yesterday resulting in success, yet the experimental setup accidentally led to a successful result, unbeknownst to them, today due to an equipment malfunction. Intuitively, we feel that this belief does not amount to knowledge despite the proper exercise of intellectual virtue.**
