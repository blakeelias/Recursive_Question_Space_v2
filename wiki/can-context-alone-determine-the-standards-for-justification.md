**Suppose we have a case in which a person is discussing a complex scientific theory in a formal academic conference. The standards for justification required for the audience to attribute knowledge to the speaker are intuitively high due to the formal setting.**, **Consider another case where the same person is discussing the same scientific theory informally with friends. Intuitively, the standards for justification may appear lower.**, **It seems implausible that the truth or falsity of the person's knowledge should depend solely on these changing standards.**
