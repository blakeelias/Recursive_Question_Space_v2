**Suppose in one context, high standards for justification are applied, while in another context, low standards are used.**, **Intuitively, we must say that a person can know a proposition in the low-standard context while not knowing the same proposition in the high-standard context.**, **It is implausible that a person can simultaneously be said to know and not know the same proposition at the same time, merely due to contextual factors.**
