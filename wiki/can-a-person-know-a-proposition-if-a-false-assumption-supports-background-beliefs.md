## Content

**Suppose a person's justified true belief relies on a network of background beliefs, some of which are false assumptions that do not directly inform the proposition. Intuitively, they may still be considered to know the proposition.**, **The presence of inconsequential false assumptions in the supporting background does not always intuitively negate the knowledge status of a justified true belief.**
