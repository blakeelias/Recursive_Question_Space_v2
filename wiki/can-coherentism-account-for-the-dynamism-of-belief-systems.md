## Content

**Consider a scenario where a belief system evolves over time, continually integrating new beliefs that remain coherent with older beliefs. Intuitively, one would judge that knowledge must account for ongoing revisions and updates rather than static coherence.**, **There is a plausible principle that the dynamism and adaptability of belief systems are crucial for maintaining knowledge. This principle suggests that static coherence at a single time may not meet the demands of constantly evolving understanding.**
