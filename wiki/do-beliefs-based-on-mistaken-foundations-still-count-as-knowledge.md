**Consider a case where someone's belief in a historical fact stems from faulty assumptions, yet the belief is true, and they understand it now directly. Intuitively, this seems like knowledge.**, **It is plausible to suggest that knowledge can be retained or gained despite the defective nature of initial beliefs if those beliefs have been corrected or are in harmony with truth.**, **Suppose there is an archaeological finding initially misunderstood but later understood with correct understanding. This scenario questions the essentiality of faultless foundational beliefs for knowing.**
