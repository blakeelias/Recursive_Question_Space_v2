## Content

**In evaluating whether a process is reliable, it's unclear how to specify the level of generality at which to describe the process. Intuitively, the level of generality can drastically change our judgment about reliability.**, **If a cognitive process is specified too broadly, nearly any belief could be seen as reliably produced, while a too narrow specification may dismiss processes that are generally effective.**, **The concept of reliability requires a coherent and defensible criterion for determining the appropriate level of generality, without which justice to knowledge assessment becomes arbitrary.**
