## Content

**Mathematical knowledge seems to lack causal connections since it involves abstract entities and necessary truths rather than empirical facts.**, **A claim about mathematical knowledge, such as a belief that 2+2=4, intuitively does not rely on causal processes.**, **Mathematical knowledge challenges the requirement of causal connections between belief and true propositions, as mathematical truths are apprehended through reason and logic rather than causal interaction.**
