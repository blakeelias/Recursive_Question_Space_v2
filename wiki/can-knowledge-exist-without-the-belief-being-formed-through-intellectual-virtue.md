## Content

**Consider a case where a person correctly believes a proposition because of a reliable cognitive process but not through an intellectual virtue, such as using unreliable memory due to accidental cues. Intuitively, the person seems to know the proposition because the belief turned out to be true.**, **There is a plausible principle that accidental correctness does not negate the status of having knowledge, indicating knowledge is possible without intellectual virtue.**
