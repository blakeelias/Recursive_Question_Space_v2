## Content

**Consider a situation in which two different individuals have coherent belief systems that are contradictory. Intuitively, we would judge that not both individuals can have justified beliefs, yet both are coherent.**, **A scenario where coherence alone serves as justification could allow for equally coherent but conflicting belief systems being seen as equally justified, which is implausible.**
