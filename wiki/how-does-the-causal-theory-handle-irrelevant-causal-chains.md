## Content

**Suppose a person believes a particular scientific fact because they have a dream that eerily resembles future experimental results. The fact is true, and their belief is unduly caused by the dream, not any empirical investigation. Intuitively, the person doesnâ€™t know the fact.**, **A causal connection that contributes nothing to the justification of a belief does not intuitively provide knowledge, even if it exists.**
