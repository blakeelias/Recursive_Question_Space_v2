**Consider a case in which a person, Sam, believes a proposition that he has a justified belief in, namely that his colleague, Taylor, owns a Ford. Sam's justification is that he has seen Taylor driving a Ford numerous times.**, **Unknown to Sam, Taylor sold the Ford yesterday but a different colleague, Jordan, just randomly won a Ford in a raffle.**, **In this case, though Sam's belief about a colleague owning a Ford is true and justified, it seems intuitionaly incorrect to say he knows that a colleague owns a Ford.**
