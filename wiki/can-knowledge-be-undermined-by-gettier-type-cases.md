# Can knowledge be undermined by Gettier-type cases?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** d5cd9734-3a32-409a-a04d-4337d933acab
**Depth:** 2
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Justified True Belief](justified-true-belief.md)

## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person sees a broken clock that reads 2:00, they form the belief it is 2:00 based on the clock, and it actually happens to be 2:00. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it is 2:00 despite having a true and justified belief.**, **The combination of a justified true belief in this scenario does not seem to be sufficient for knowledge, indicating that some other condition might be necessary for knowledge beyond belief, justification, and truth.**
