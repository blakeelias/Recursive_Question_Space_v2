**Consider a scenario where a person has a true justified belief that a particular horse will win a race, based on testimony. Unbeknownst to the person, the testimony is false, but through an unrelated disturbance, the horse actually wins. Intuitively, we may judge that this person does not know the horse will win, despite satisfying no false assumptions.**, **It is possible for a belief to be true, justified, and not based on false assumptions, while still not counting as knowledge due to an unexplored connection between the justification and the truth of the belief.**
