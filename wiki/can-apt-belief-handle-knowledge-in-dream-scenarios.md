**Consider a scenario where a person dreams they are at work and upon waking, discovers that they truly were. Intuitively, such beliefs are not considered apt or knowledgeable because they lack the element of skillful belief formation.**, **It is implausible that fitting a fortuitously true dream into the apt belief framework accounts for knowledge.**
