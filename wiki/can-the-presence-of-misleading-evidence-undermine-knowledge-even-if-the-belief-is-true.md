**Suppose there is a person named Bob who receives two pieces of evidence about a lottery: one source is reliable and tells him he has lost, while an unreliable source tells him he has won. Bob, disregarding the reliable source due to deceptive practices in the past and trusting the unreliable one by mistake, believes he has won. However, he actually has won the lottery. Intuitively, Bob does not know he has won the lottery, even though his belief is true.**, **This suggests that justification must connect to truth in the right way; misleading justification does not transform true belief into knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of the classic account.**
