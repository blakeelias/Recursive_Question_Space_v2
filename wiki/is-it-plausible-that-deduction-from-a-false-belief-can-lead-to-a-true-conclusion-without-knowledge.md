**Suppose there is a case where a student, Lucy, wrongly believes her professor canceled their class today based on a rumor. Since it is Monday, she concludes there will be no class today as a general rule. Coincidentally, the professor cancels class for an unrelated reason. Lucy's conclusion is true but derived from a false belief. Intuitively, Lucy does not know the class is canceled, even with a justified true belief.**, **This scenario suggests that deductions from false beliefs, even leading to a true conclusion, complicate the view that justification, belief, and truth are sufficient for knowledge.**
