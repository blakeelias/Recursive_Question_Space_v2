**Consider a scenario where the reliability of a cognitive process varies according to circumstances or contexts, such as a person using a mobile phone for navigation in both urban and rural areas with differing signal qualities affecting accuracy. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that whether the process is reliable, and hence whether there is knowledge, depends on external contexts.**, **Context-dependent variability in reliability challenges the notion of a fixed reliable process being sufficient for knowledge.**
