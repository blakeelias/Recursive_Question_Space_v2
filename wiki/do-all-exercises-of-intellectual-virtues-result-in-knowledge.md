## Content

**A principle suggests that exercising intellectual virtue should result in knowledge whenever the resulting belief is true. However, instances where someone forms a belief through intellectual virtues like careful observation, but overlooks a misleading element, suggests intuitive skepticism about such beliefs being knowledge.**, **Imagine a diligent journalist verifying sources, convinced of a true story but failing to notice a critical misleading detail that falsifies the story in other cases. Reliable virtues appear insufficient for declaring the belief as knowledge in such nuanced circumstances.**
