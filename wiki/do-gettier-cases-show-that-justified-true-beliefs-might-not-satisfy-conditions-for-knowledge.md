**Consider a scenario where a person, Sam, sees their neighbor's car in the driveway and forms a justified belief that their neighbor is at home. Unknown to Sam, the neighbor left but borrowed another person's identical car. Even though the belief is true, intuitively Sam does not have knowledge.**, **Gettier-type scenarios demonstrate that justified true belief may not fulfill the conditions for knowledge.**
