## Content

**Suppose a person forms an apt belief under usual conditions, yet would hold the belief even if it were false under slightly changed circumstances. Intuitively, this suggests a lack of knowledge.**, **Sensitivity means that if a belief had been false, the person wouldn't hold it. A belief's aptness without sensitivity can lead to truth in an imprudent manner, contrasting with strong intuitions about what constitutes knowledge.**
