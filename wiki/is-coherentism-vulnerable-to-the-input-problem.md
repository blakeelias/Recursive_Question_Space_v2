**Coherentism focuses on the relationships between beliefs, but it may not specify how initial beliefs are acquired and integrated into a system.**, **The input problem raises concerns about how new information is incorporated into a belief system in a way that maintains coherence and leads to knowledge.**, **If coherentism cannot adequately specify how new beliefs must be processed or added to systems responsibly, it challenges its efficacy in explaining how knowledge is reliably formed and expanded.**
