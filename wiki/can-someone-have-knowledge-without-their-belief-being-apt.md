**Consider a scenario where someone forms a true belief about the location of their keys because they guessed randomly. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that they do not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to be apt, it must be formed through a reliable or skillful method. Guessing randomly does not meet this criterion.**
