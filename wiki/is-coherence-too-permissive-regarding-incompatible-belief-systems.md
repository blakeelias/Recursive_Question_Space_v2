## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people have coherent but mutually incompatible belief systems about metaphysical issues, based on different cultures. Intuitively, it doesn't seem each can equally claim knowledge given this mutual exclusivity.**, **It is implausible that coherence can justify knowledge claims equally well across such incompatible systems within contexts where truth is competitive.**, **There is a plausible principle that standardizing knowledge across divergent coherent systems leads to a relativistic endpoint where mutual exclusivity erodes objective claims.**
