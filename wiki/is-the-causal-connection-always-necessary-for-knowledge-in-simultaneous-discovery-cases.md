# Is the causal connection always necessary for knowledge in simultaneous discovery cases?

**Node Type:** antithesis
**Node ID:** 9186e156-48ce-4447-85e5-e60e05808483
**Depth:** 2
**Terminal:** No

**Parent:** [Causal Theory](causal-theory.md)

## Content

**Suppose a mathematician independently proves a theorem that another mathematician has already proven; both arrive at the truth independently. Intuitively, both have knowledge of the theorem without a causal connection between the propositions.**, **A plausible principle is that independent verification provides knowledge when results are determined through valid reasoning or methodologies, not contingent on direct causal connection.**
