**Consider an example where a revolutionary scientific theory radically alters established beliefs, creating initial incoherence within the scientific community. Intuitively, one would say that new knowledge can arise from initial incoherence during a paradigm shift.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must account for the potential for radically new insights. This principle questions whether coherence is sufficient if it cannot easily accommodate breakthrough knowledge that initially seems incoherent.**
