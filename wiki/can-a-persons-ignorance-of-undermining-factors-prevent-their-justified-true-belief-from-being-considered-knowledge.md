**Suppose someone believes an accident will occur due to icy roads without knowing a salt crew just treated the roads, preventing accidents. Their belief is true as an accident occurs for unrelated reasons. Intuitively, we hesitate to attribute knowledge due to the unawareness of defeaters, which may not involve false lemmas.**, **The possibility of unknown undermining factors indicates that being free of false lemmas is not entirely sufficient for grounding knowledge.**
