**Consider a case where a person forms a belief through a usually unreliable process, like guessing, but happens to hit the truth by chance. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to say they know the proposition even if it turns out true.**, **Knowledge intuitively requires more than just being right; it needs a reliable mechanism, not just a lucky hit, challenging the simplistic view of reliability sufficiency.**
