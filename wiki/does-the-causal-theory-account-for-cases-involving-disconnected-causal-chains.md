**Suppose a person believes a proposition because of a misleading evidence, and by pure coincidence, the proposition is true. There is no appropriate causal connection between the belief and the truth of the proposition. In this scenario, it's intuitive to say that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A person could arrive at a true belief through a faulty causal chain, such as believing it will rain based solely on a broken barometer that coincidentally happens to indicate the weather correctly. In such a scenario, without a proper causal link, knowledge does not seem to be present.**
