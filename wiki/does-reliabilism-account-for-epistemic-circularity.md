**Consider a scenario where a person uses a specific process to determine whether the process itself is reliable. Intuitively, this use of the process to justify itself seems circular and problematic for establishing genuine knowledge.**, **It is implausible that reliance on the same cognitive process being evaluated can sufficiently justify its own reliability and hence yield knowledge. This challenges the reliabilist need for the cognitive process to be independently verified.**
