**A reliable cognitive process is defined by its general tendency to produce true beliefs, effectively judged by probabilistic outcomes over time.**, **In specific instances, this probabilistic reliability may result in false beliefs without affecting the overall reliability rating of the process.**, **The reliance on probabilistic outcomes poses a problem for individual instances of supposed knowledge if reliability is judged only in aggregate rather than on singular cases.**
