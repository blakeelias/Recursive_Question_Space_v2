## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a child believes a simple math truth through rote learning and repetition, without conceptual understanding. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the child's belief, although possibly accurate, reflects memorization rather than insight or skill.**, **It is implausible to count repetition or recall as fully satisfying knowledge conditions where skill or critical engagement is not evident.**
