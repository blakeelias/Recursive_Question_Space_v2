## Content

**Consider a scientist who believes a deeply held scientific theory that turns out to be based on some false auxiliary hypothesis. Intuitively, we might view the scientific belief as knowledge before the auxiliary hypothesis was disproven.**, **In this scenario, the 'no false lemmas' rule implies the scientist did not have knowledge, which seems contrary to how scientific knowledge functions.**
