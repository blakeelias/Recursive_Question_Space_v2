**Consider a scenario where a reliable cognitive process leads to belief in a false proposition due to unforeseen factors, such as someone who accurately perceives their surroundings but is misled by a realistic hallucination. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that even though the process is reliable, the person does not know the proposition due to its falsehood.**, **Reliable cognitive processes can occasionally yield false beliefs, thereby making the process alone insufficient for producing knowledge.**
