## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person with a cognitive defect forms a true belief that arises from using unreliable cognitive faculties. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not know the proposition even if the belief is true.**, **A plausible principle is that intellectual virtue must involve reliable cognitive faculties. This principle together with the presence of unreliable cognitive faculties suggests the absence of knowledge.**
