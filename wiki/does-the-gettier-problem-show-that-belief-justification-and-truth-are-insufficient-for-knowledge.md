**Consider a case in which Smith has strong evidence for the belief that the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket. Smith has counted the coins in Jones's pocket and believes Jones will get the job. However, Smith himself also has ten coins in his pocket and unbeknownst to him, he will get the job. Intuitively, Smith does not have knowledge despite having a justified true belief.**, **This case suggests that having a true belief with justification is not sufficient for knowledge because the truth is achieved by luck.**
