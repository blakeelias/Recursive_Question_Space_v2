**Imagine a scenario where a person, through sheer chance, forms a true belief without any motivation to do so, such as answering a question correctly in a game of Trivial Pursuit without caring about correctness. Intuitively, we would not consider this as knowledge due to the absence of intentional engagement with the belief.**, **Intellectual virtue often involves motivation or intent to know, suggesting that random acquisition of true belief lacks the component necessary to be considered knowledge.**
