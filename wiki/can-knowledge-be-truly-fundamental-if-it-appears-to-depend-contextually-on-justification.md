## Content

**The contextual variability in what counts as justified knowledge questions whether knowledge can universally be fundamental without accounting for those contextual shifts.**, **Consider academic versus layperson discussions where standards for knowledge claims diverge significantly. Intuitively, knowledge depends on context, challenging the idea that it is universally fundamental and pointing instead to it being situationally constructed.**
