**A sound epistemological theory should ensure that knowledge is as universally applicable as possible.**, **If the standards for justification vary widely between contexts, then the same knowledge claim may be accepted or rejected based purely on situational factors.**, **This variability can lead to a situation where knowledge becomes merely a function of the prevailing social or cultural context, rather than being based on more universal standards.**
