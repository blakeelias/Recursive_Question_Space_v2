**Suppose a person has an unjustified belief, but it happens to be true by sheer luck, such as claiming it will rain tomorrow based solely on intuition. Intuitively, we do not consider this knowledge despite the absence of false lemmas.**, **The absence of false assumptions does not guarantee knowledge if the belief's truth is coincidental or lacks appropriate justification.**
