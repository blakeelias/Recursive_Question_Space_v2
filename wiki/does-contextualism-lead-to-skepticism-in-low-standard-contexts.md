**There is a plausible principle that if standards for justification vary across contexts, then there can be contexts where the standards are so low that almost no justification is required for knowledge.**, **If low-standard contexts allow for minimal justification, intuitively it seems that we might mistakenly attribute knowledge to individuals who possess mere true belief without robust evidence.**, **It is implausible that individuals possess knowledge in cases where their justification is minimal and close to a mere guess.**
