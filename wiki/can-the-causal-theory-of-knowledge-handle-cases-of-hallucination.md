**Consider a situation where a person in a desert hallucinates an oasis. They believe there is an oasis nearby. In reality, there is an oasis in that direction but their belief was formed due to the hallucination, not from any causal connection with the actual oasis. Intuitively, the person does not know there is an oasis.**, **This scenario suggests that merely having a causal connection between a belief and its truth is not sufficient for knowledge if the belief is not causally connected in an appropriate way.**
