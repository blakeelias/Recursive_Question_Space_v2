**Consider a scenario where a person believes there is water in a glass because it looks like water, which is justified and true. Intuitively, if they then learn there are scientifically deceptive environments where the same visual evidence occasionally leads to false beliefs, their belief lacks the stability required for knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge cannot be undermined by the presence of reasonably plausible doubts or defeaters, yet justified true belief doesn't rule this out.**
