**Suppose someone believes they have hands due to immediate perception. Intuitively, they rely on this belief daily.**, **In a skeptical scenario where they could be a brain in a vat with false perceptions, the person would still believe they have hands because of similar experiences.**, **Sensitivity Theory implies they do not know they have hands if such skeptical possibilities cannot be ruled out, potentially granting too much to the skeptic.**
