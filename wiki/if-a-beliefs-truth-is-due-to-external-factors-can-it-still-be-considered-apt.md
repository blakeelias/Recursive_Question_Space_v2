**Imagine a person believes a proposition correctly only because of an unforeseen outside influence, such as a lucky event. The belief is true and accurate.**, **While true, the correctness here isn't due to any skill on behalf of the believer, thus challenging the notion of such a belief being adroitly formed under the aptness condition for knowledge.**
