## Content

**Consider a scenario where two independently reliable processes accidentally align to produce a true belief, similar to Gettier cases. Intuitively, we might not regard this as genuine knowledge since the truth of the belief is due in part to luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than a convergence of reliability and truth; it requires a direct causal link between the reliability of the process and the truth of the belief. This principle indicates that reliabilism alone doesn't account for epistemic luck.**
