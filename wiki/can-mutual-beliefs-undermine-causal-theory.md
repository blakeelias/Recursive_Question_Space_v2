## Content

**Two individuals may share a belief and both come to know something through communicating about it in a non-causal way.**, **Their belief might be true and they might each believe it, yet mutual causation complicates the notion of a single causal chain leading to each person's belief.**, **In such cases, the shared nature of belief challenges the requirement for a single 'appropriate' causal connection.**
