**Imagine a person believes a fair coin will land heads based on unjustified confidence, the coin indeed lands heads, but they don't know the result was truly heads because their belief was not based on proper justification.**, **Suppose a person believes their friend will arrive at 3 PM due to an inaccurate but reliable clock reading, where the friend coincidentally arrives exactly at 3 PM.
