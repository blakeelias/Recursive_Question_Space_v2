## Content

**Consider a scenario where the standards for justification shift between two contexts for the same claim, like assessments in different academic seminars. If the same evidence results in "knowledge" in one context but not in the other, intuitively, this inconsistency undercuts the stable meaning of "knowledge."**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should remain consistent regardless of varying conversational contexts. This principle, combined with scenarios where justification standards differ, implies an internal contradiction in holding different knowledge standards without external change.**
