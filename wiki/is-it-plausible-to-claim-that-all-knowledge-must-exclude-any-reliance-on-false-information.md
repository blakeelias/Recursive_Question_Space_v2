**In scientific contexts, researchers often rely on approximations and models that are strictly speaking false, yet they lead to true and justified conclusions.**, **A physics student using Newtonian mechanics believes an effective gravitational calculation, which is true within its scope but relies on false assumptions about the nature of gravity.**, **This suggests that some justified true beliefs based on false assumptions can still lead to knowledge when applied correctly.**
