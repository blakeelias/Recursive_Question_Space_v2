## Content

**Consider a scenario where each belief requires justification from another belief, creating a potential infinite regress of justifications which foundationalism seeks to halt with foundational beliefs**, **Intuitively, stopping the regress with foundational beliefs does not necessarily solve the problem unless the foundational beliefs themselves are shown to be truly justified**, **The mere stipulation of foundational beliefs halting the regress does not resolve the issue of their own justification, leaving the regress problem unresolved**
