**Higher-order knowledge involves knowing that one knows a proposition. Reliabilism primarily addresses first-order knowledge and does not clarify how one can reliably know they have met the conditions for knowledge itself.**, **Consider a person who knows a fact but is unsure whether they possess knowledge due to lack of awareness of their belief's production process. Intuitively, a distinction is present that reliabilism does not address.**
