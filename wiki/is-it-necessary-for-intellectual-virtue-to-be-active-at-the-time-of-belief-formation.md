## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual has a true belief based on previously exercised intellectual virtues but does not engage actively in them while forming the belief. Intuitively, this individual could still possess knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that past exercises of intellectual virtue may ground knowledge independently of concurrent active intellectual virtue, challenging the necessity component.**
