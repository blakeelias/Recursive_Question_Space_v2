## Content

**Suppose a committee reaches a true conclusion based on combining different members' inaccurate but individually apt beliefs. Intuitively, the committee as a whole might seem to 'know' the proposition, despite the process differing from individual apt belief.**, **Knowledge attributions to groups often depend on varied epistemic processes that don't neatly map onto the concept of individual apt belief. Thus, the aptness criterion may not encompass all cases of genuine knowledge for collective entities.**
