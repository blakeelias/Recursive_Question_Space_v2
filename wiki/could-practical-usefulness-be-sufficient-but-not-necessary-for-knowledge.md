**Consider a scenario in which an individual unknowingly holds a true belief that turns out to be practically irrelevant within their lifetime. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the individual still knows the proposition despite its lack of practical utility.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth and belief can constitute knowledge irrespective of practical success, which implies that practical usefulness is not necessary for knowledge.**
