## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's justification for a belief is robust and aligned with all available evidence, yet the possibility of uncovering an undiscovered truth always remains, which could serve as a defeater. Intuition suggests there is theoretically always a potential defeater in any situation.**, **A plausible principle is that requiring indefeasibility of justification for knowledge sets an impossibly high standard, as knowledge would become unattainable due to the omnipresent potential for defeasibility in every belief.**
