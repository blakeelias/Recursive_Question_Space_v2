## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justification, in addition to truth and belief. This principle suggests that without justification, true beliefs, even formed through intellectual virtue, might not count as knowledge.**, **Imagine a scenario where a person believes a true proposition but lacks any justification or reason for this belief. Intuitively, we would consider this not to be knowledge.**
