**Suppose a chess player makes a move out of habit rather than belief in its correctness, leading to victory. Intuitively, they do not know the move is the best without belief in its efficacy despite practical success.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, belief is necessary, further indicating practical success from habit does not suffice for knowledge.**
