**It is plausible to consider a situation where a person accurately predicts the outcome of a future event, such as a coin toss, without observing the event directly. In this case, the person may believe the proposition, the proposition might be true, but there is no causal connection between the future event and their belief.**, **If a prediction about the future comes true merely by chance, without a causal link, it is difficult to argue that the predictor knows the outcome even if their prediction was correct and they believed it to be so.**
