## Content

**Imagine a scenario where an individual has practical, action-directed knowledge that effectively guides them, although this knowledge is susceptible to irrelevant true defeaters. Intuitively, we might find that practical success validates the knowledge.**, **A strict condition against any true defeaters might disregard how some knowledge serves practical purposes effectively despite potential but inapplicable defeaters.**, **If knowledge evaluated solely on theoretical defeaters neglects its success in practical contexts, this condition might be too idealized for real-world applications.**
