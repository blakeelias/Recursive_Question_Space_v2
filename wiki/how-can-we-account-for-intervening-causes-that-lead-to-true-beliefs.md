## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief through an accidental causal chain involving multiple intervening factors. Intuitively, we may hesitate to call this knowledge.**, **An appropriate causal connection might not be present if the causal process includes significant accidental or coincidental elements.**, **In such cases, the causal chain seems insufficient for ensuring that the belief truly results in knowledge.**
