**Knowledge is often understood as dynamic and subject to revision with new evidence or reasoning.**, **If foundational beliefs are fixed and non-revisable, then they cannot accommodate this dynamic aspect of knowledge.**, **Suppose new evidence significantly undermines a foundational belief, intuitively it should be revisable, but foundationalism might not allow for this adaptation.**
