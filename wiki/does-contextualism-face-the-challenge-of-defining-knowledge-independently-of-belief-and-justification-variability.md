**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition. Consider a case where belief remains constant, but justification standards change across contexts, affecting whether "knowledge" is affirmed. Intuitively, if belief remains but knowledge vanishes merely through context, then context, not belief, dominates the epistemic status.**, **For knowledge, if belief and justification are both necessary, then allowing variability in one (justification) without substantive change in the other leads to a logical tension about what constitutes knowledge.**
