**Consider a scenario in which two coworkers, Smith and Jones, are applying for a promotion. Smith has strong evidence for the proposition that Jones will get the job, as the boss has assured Smith of this. Smith also knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. Smith concludes that the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket. However, unbeknownst to Smith, Jones does not get the job; Smith does. Coincidentally, Smith also has ten coins in his pocket. In this scenario, Smith has a justified true belief that the person who will get the job has ten coins in their pocket, but intuitively Smith does not know this.**
