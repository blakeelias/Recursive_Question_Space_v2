## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a stock price will rise and it does, based solely on a hunch rather than market analysis. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the price will rise or that they merely got lucky. If we say they know, then we underplay the role of informed reasoning. If we say they do not know, then accuracy must connect more robustly with knowledge than mere intuition.**
