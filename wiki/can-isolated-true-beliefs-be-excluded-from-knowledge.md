## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person, by random chance, comes to believe a true proposition without any other related beliefs. Intuitively, we might judge that this person has knowledge despite the lack of coherence with a system of beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that if a person holds a true belief about the time because they looked at a broken clock which happens to show the correct time, isolating this belief from their other beliefs, they lack coherence.**, **It is implausible that the isolation of a true belief, without further supporting beliefs, removes the status of knowledge.**
