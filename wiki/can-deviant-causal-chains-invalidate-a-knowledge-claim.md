## Content

**Imagine a person learns that there is fire due to smelling smoke and seeing flames. However, the fire was artificially started for a fire safety drill, unbeknownst to them. Intuitively, this person might be said not to know about a 'real' fire threat due to the deviant causal chain.**, **A causal chain that leads to a true belief might deviate from what we accept as normal, indicating knowledge is not solely about a causal link's presence but about the nature of the causal chain.**
