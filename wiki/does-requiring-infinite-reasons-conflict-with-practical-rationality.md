## Content

**Practical rationality suggests that agents ought to form beliefs based on sufficient reasons that are accessible and comprehensible. If infinite reasons are necessary for justification, it contradicts this aspect of practical rationality.**, **Consider a situation where a person has comprehensive but finite reasons for believing a practical proposition. Intuitively, we would think they are rational in holding this belief and thus possessing knowledge.**
