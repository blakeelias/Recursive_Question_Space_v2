**Suppose we have a case in which an individual reasons skillfully and normally would reach a true conclusion, but due to deceptive epistemic environments, the belief ends up false. Intuitively, we either need to say the process was apt or it wasn't. If we say it was confident, it challenges the necessity of aptness being directly connected to achieving truth.**
