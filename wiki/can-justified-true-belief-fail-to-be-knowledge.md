## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition based on a justified belief that turns out to be true, but the justification is based on a false premise. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the proposition.**, **A case in which a person believes it is 12 PM because they see a clock showing 12 PM, and the clock has stopped working but happens to show the correct time twice a day, illustrates that the person does not have knowledge, despite their belief being justified and true.**
