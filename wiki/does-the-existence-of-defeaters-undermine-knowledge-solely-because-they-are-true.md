**Suppose a person has a justified true belief that a bird is a robin after consulting a reliable bird guide, but unknown to them, a rare circumstance renders the guide's identification incorrect, even though the bird is indeed a robin. Intuitively, the person's belief still qualifies as knowledge.**, **If the defeat turns out to be irrelevant to the truth of the proposition believed, it seems implausible for it to undermine the person's knowledge.**
