## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a false proposition that leads to practical success in their actions, such as practicing a superstition that inadvertently keeps them safe. Intuitively, we either have to say that such a person knows the superstition is true or that they do not**, **If we say the person knows the superstition is true, then we must accept that false propositions can be known**, **If we say the person does not know the superstition is true, then practical success cannot solely determine knowledge**
