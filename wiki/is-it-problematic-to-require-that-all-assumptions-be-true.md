**Imagine someone uses multiple assumptions to justify a belief, yet one trivial and irrelevant assumption turns out false. The belief is true and justified, and intuitively we still might consider it knowledge.**, **A principle can be posited where irrelevant falsehoods do not undermine the status of a belief being knowledge if the true main reasoning remains intact.**
