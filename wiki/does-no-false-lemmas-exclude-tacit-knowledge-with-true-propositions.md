## Content

**Suppose we have a scientist who makes an accurate prediction based on long experience and intuition. Their prediction includes no false assumptions but is not backed by explicit reasoning or proof. Intuitively, the scientist knows something correctly without overtly avoiding false lemmas because their reasoning is not formalized.**, **It is implausible that knowledge requires articulation of every assumption as true or false, particularly in cases where tacit knowledge is exercised effectively without explicit examination of the assumptions.**
