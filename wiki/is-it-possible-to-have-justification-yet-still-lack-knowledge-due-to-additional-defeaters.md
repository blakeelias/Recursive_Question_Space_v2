## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person has a justified true belief but overlooks a crucial fact that serves as a defeater to their justification, like having justified belief itâ€™s a maple tree based on leaf shape while unaware of it being artificial. Intuitively, we understand this belief does not constitute knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires not only stability of justification but also the absence of any additional information that could undermine the justification, which mere justified true belief might not protect against.**
