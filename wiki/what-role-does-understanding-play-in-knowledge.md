## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a belief that is true and justified but lacks an understanding of why the belief is true. Intuitively, this lack of understanding prevents us from considering their belief to be true knowledge.**, **It is plausible that understanding requires an awareness of the reasons or mechanisms underpinning a justified true belief, suggesting that mere true belief and justification are insufficient without understanding.**
