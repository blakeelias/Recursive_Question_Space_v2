**Consider a case where a person has a justified belief in a proposition based on strong, misleading evidence that accidentally turns out to be true. For instance, someone reads multiple reliable newspapers stating the same false information, but the conclusion drawn from this evidence is a correct guess. Intuitively, we would judge this person lacks knowledge despite having a justified true belief.**
