**Suppose there is a case where a personâ€™s belief is formed by a reliable process, but in close possible worlds where the belief would be false, the person would still believe it. Intuitively, this undermines the notion of knowledge.**, **Reliability attempts to account for truth connections but does not necessarily consider sensitivity or responsiveness to changes in truth conditions.**, **If a belief fails to track the truth under close alternative conditions, the reliability of the cognitive process is questionable in its capacity to confer knowledge.**
