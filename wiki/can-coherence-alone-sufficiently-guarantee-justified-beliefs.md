## Content

**For a person to believe a proposition, it does not necessarily imply that their belief is justified even if it coheres with other beliefs.**, **Consider a coherent system of beliefs based on unreliable evidence or faulty logic. Even if beliefs cohere, the coherence itself does not guarantee truth or justification.**, **There is a plausible principle that justification should depend on evidence or a reliable process, not just coherence. This principle suggests coherence alone may not suffice for justification.**
