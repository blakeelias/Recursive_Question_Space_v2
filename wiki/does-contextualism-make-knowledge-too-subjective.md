**There is a plausible principle that knowledge is supposed to be about an objective relationship between belief, truth, and justification.**, **If standards for justification vary with context, then knowledge becomes partly dependent on subjective factors like cultural or situational contexts.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, which should be objective, could appropriately vary with subjective contexts, as this undermines its universal applicability.**
