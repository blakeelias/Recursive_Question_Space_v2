**Infinite series of reasons might eventually start repeating or form a circular structure, which undermines their role as non-repeating justificatory grounds.**, **Circular justifications are typically dismissed as invalid in epistemology, yet an infinite chain might inadvertently collapse into circularity over time.**, **If non-repetition is strictly required, then the plausibility of achieving it in an infinite regress is questionable, thus threatening the idea of justified knowledge.**
