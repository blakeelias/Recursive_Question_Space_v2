**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief by a reliable cognitive process but is in a rare environment where similar processes usually produce false beliefs. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **A reliable process is typically seen as one that produces true beliefs in a high percentage of cases across relevantly similar situations.**, **If the environment is such that similar processes would mostly lead to false beliefs, then the reliability of the cognitive process should be in question, affecting the status of any knowledge claim.**
