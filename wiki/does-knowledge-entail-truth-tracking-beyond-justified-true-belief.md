**Suppose a person, Emma, sees what appears to be her friend riding a bike through a park and believes it's her friend, Alex, because it looks like Alex and Alex often rides there. Coincidentally, it is indeed Alex. However, had she looked slightly further, she would have seen it was an impersonator in disguise while Alex is coincidentally behind them on another bike. Although her belief is justified and true, it fails to track the truth properly, suggesting she does not know Alex is there.**
