## Content

**Consider a mathematician who discovers a theoretical truth with no present application but greatly extends mathematical knowledge. Intuitively, this discovery is knowledge even if not practically useful.**, **It is impausible to assert that lack of immediate practical application disqualifies a mathematical discovery as knowledge, since future utility is not determinative of present knowledge status.**
