## Content

**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true. Suppose we have a case where varying contexts seem to affect whether someone knows a proposition, despite the truth remaining constant. Intuitively, if truth is invariant, knowledge claims should not vary solely based on context.**, **There is a plausible principle that truth remains constant across contexts. This principle together with contextual shifts in knowledge standards implies a contradiction if truth does not equate to stable knowledge.**
