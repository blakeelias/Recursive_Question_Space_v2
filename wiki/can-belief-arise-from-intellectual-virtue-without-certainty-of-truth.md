## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person exercises intellectual virtue by forming a belief based on thorough evidence and logical reasoning; however, due to unforeseen deception, the belief turns out to be false. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the belief arises from an exercise of intellectual virtue but is not knowledge.**, **It is implausible that a belief arising from intellectual virtue guarantees knowledge when external factors can lead to the belief being false.**
