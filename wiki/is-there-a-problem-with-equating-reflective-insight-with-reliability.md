**Imagine a case where higher-order insight about a belief's reliability conflicts with actual unreliability. Intuitively, one should not possess reflective knowledge if the insight is misguided.**, **The concept of reflective knowledge presupposes accurate insight, and any discrepancy renders the insight ineffectual for genuine knowledge.**, **There is a plausible expectation that reflective insight should accurately map onto actual reliability to constitute reflective knowledge.**
