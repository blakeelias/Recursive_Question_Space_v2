## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person hallucinates an event and forms a belief that coincidentally corresponds to the reality of that event. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know about the event through hallucination.**, **In case of hallucination, the supposed causal link is spurious and the true belief occurs by coincidence rather than an appropriate causal connection.**, **The presence of such coincidental true beliefs challenges causal theory since it lacks genuine causation between the fact and the belief.**
