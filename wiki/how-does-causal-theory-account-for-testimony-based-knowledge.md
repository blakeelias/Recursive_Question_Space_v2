## Content

**Suppose a person knows a proposition because someone else told them, e.g., learning historical facts from a trustworthy source. The belief's causal link is not directly between the individual and the truth, but via another person.**, **In such scenarios of knowledge gained through testimony, the causal link does not directly connect the believer to the proposition, yet we intuitively accept this as knowledge.**
