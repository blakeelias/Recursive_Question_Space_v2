**Suppose a person correctly believes a proposition due to what they mistakenly identify as the correct causal evidence, yet the actual link is different. An example would be someone believing a weather forecast based on misinterpreted scientific data that unintentionally led to a correct belief.**, **In this scenario, although the belief is true and there is a causal link, the misunderstanding of the causal link leads us to question whether true knowledge is present.**
