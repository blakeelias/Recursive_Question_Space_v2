**Suppose evidence overwhelmingly suggests one conclusion, but a reliable process leads to a true belief in the opposite conclusion. Our intuition is that the reliance on misleading evidence should weaken claims of knowledge, even if the belief ends up being correct.**, **The principle that considers the impact of contrary evidence suggests that conclusions based on clear but misleading evidence often lack the certainty associated with knowledge, which is not accounted for by externalism's focus on reliability.**
