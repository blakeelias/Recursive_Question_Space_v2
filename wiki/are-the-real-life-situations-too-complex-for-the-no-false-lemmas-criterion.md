**In complex real-life situations, beliefs often arise from a web of direct and indirect assumptions that are difficult to separate into unequivocally true or false categories.**, **This interconnectedness means that the presence of some doubt or misinformation does not always prevent the acquisition of knowledge.**, **If real-life situations resist clear-cut separation of lemmas, the 'No False Lemmas' criterion might be impractical or overly restrictive.**
