## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person watches a pre-recorded live event replay and believes it's happening live. Intuitively, we would say that they have justified true belief, but they lack knowledge because there was no direct causal connection to the event.**, **It is implausible that knowing something is happening requires only that the information is true and justified without any causal link to the actual event.**
