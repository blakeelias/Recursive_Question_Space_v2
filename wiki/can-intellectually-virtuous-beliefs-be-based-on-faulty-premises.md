## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person exercises intellectual virtues but bases their belief on a false premise. Intuitively, we either have to say they possess knowledge or they do not. If we say they possess knowledge, then it contradicts the truth condition. If we say they do not, it challenges the role of virtue.**, **It is plausible that the exercise of intellectual virtue can be based on incorrect information, which complicates the idea that knowledge must involve truth and intellectual virtue.**
