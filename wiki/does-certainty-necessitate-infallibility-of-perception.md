## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person, relying on their senses, believes with absolute certainty that the sun will rise tomorrow. Intuitively, their belief can still be considered knowledge even if the belief might not be immune from doubt due to possible unknown future events.**, **Perception, which underpins much of human knowledge, has inherent limitations and is not infallible, suggesting absolute certainty is not a foundational criterion for knowledge.**
