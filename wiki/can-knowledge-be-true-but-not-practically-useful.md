**A belief can be true but lack practical usefulness in a given context, such as knowing a historical fact that has no impact on present decisions**, **It is implausible that the absence of practical usefulness alone precludes the status of knowledge**, **If true beliefs without practical utility cannot be considered knowledge, then much of what we consider knowledge, such as abstract mathematical theorems, would be excluded**
