**Suppose someone generally trusts a reliable news source but hears a report that contradicts their strong personal beliefs, which leads to significant doubt. Intuitively, their persistent doubt casts uncertainty on their possession of knowledge, despite external reliability.**, **A principle that aligns with this intuition is that internal conviction is relevant to what one knows. However, under externalism, the existence of doubt would not negate the sufficient conditions for knowledge, which seems counterintuitive.**
