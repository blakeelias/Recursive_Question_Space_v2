## Content

**An individual's belief may become apt only within specific social or historical contexts that were not considered under general notions of cognitive adroitness.**, **Social and historical circumstances might uniquely inform a belief's aptness, whereas traditional definitions focus solely on cognitive skill without account of context, risking oversimplification of knowledge.**, **The relevance of aptness in social and historical contexts creates potential oversights in defining what makes knowledge distinct, especially if such contexts shape belief directionally.**
