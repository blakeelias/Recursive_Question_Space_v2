**There is a plausible principle that if someone's belief is true merely by luck, then it cannot be knowledge. This principle suggests that aptness must intimately connect the truth of the belief with the believer's skill or competence.**, **Consider a situation where someone correctly guesses the outcome of a complex event without relevant expertise. Intuitively, we would judge that the person lacks knowledge because the truth was not due to any skill.**
