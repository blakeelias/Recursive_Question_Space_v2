**A plausible principle is that for a belief to be knowledge, it should be reliably formed and sensitive to the truth. This principle suggests that a belief could count as knowledge even if unknown true defeaters exist, as long as the belief is formed under reliable conditions.**, **There are cases where a person knows a proposition due to the reliability of their methods, even when there are true defeaters they are unaware of. This suggests that knowing might not necessitate the absence of true defeaters if reliability is maintained.**
