**There is a principle that truth is universal, meaning it should not vary depending on who is asserting it or in what context.**, **Under contextualism, what justifies belief, and thus what qualifies as knowledge, may differ between contexts, potentially challenging this principle.**, **Intuitively, this could lead to situations where mutually exclusive truths are sanctioned by different standards, clashing with universal truth.**
