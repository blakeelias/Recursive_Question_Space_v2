**Consider a scenario in which a conspiracy theorist's beliefs are coherent internally but are widely acknowledged to be false regarding the events they describe. Intuitively, we still feel these beliefs lack the truth necessary for knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence with one's belief system inherently corrects false components when these are widely substantiated by reliable evidence as false.**, **Suppose someone establishes coherent beliefs about an imaginary world unrelated to truths about the actual world.
