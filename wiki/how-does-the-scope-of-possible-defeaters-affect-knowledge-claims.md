## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition with supporting evidence and no known true defeaters, but endless unknown potential defeaters could exist. Intuitively, limiting knowledge by expanding defeaters' scope seems unwarranted.**, **It is implausible to require knowledge claims to withstand all logically conceivable defeaters, as this sets an unreasonably high bar for knowing.**
