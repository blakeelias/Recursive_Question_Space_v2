## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms an apt belief about their examination score through their skillful calculations but a clerical error almost led to a failure. Intuitively, we either have to say that they have knowledge or that they do not. If we say they have knowledge, then it seems counterintuitive given the luck involved. If we say they do not, it challenges the link between apt belief and knowledge.**
