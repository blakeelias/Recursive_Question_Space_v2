## Content

**Suppose a person correctly believes the location of a hidden treasure without any foundational reasoning, just by sheer luck. Intuitively, this lacks knowledge, questioning whether truth alone suffices even with foundational backing.**, **There is a plausible principle suggesting that mere true belief does not constitute knowledge, especially in cases of accidental truths, which weakens the emphasis on foundationalism.**, **The appeal to cases of fortuitous guessing indicates that foundational or reasoned support is crucial for differentiating knowledge from mere belief, yet foundationalism may mischaracterize this relation.**
