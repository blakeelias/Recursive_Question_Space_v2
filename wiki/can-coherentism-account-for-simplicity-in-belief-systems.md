## Content

**Simple belief systems are often preferred due to their ease of use and understanding, yet coherence does not inherently value simplicity.**, **A belief system could be complex and still coherent, but this may not align with the practical preference for simpler, more parsimonious systems of belief.**, **This suggests a possible limitation of coherentism, as it might ignore the practical advantage or cognitive efficiency found in simpler systems that aid in navigating knowledge.**
