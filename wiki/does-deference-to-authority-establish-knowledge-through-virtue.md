## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a true belief by deferring to an authority figure without understanding the underlying reasoning. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief does not arise from intellectual virtue, as it lacks critical engagement.**, **A plausible principle is that intellectual virtue includes understanding and critical reasoning. This principle together with uncritical deference undermines the claim of exercising intellectual virtue.**
