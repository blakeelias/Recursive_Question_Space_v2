## Content

**Suppose a structural or theoretical change regarding a fact occurs, altering the truth value of a proposition. Intuitively, the binary nature of truth creates complications in judging knowledge over time.**, **It is implausible to wholly rely on a binary understanding of truth to assess knowledge given the fluidity of understanding in advancing theories or contexts, hinting at insufficiency in the knowledge conditions provided.**
