**Consider a case where an appearance in favor occurred long ago, but the knowledge is claimed in the present without immediate recollection.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, the passage of time may erode the sufficiency of the original appearance for current knowledge.**, **Phenomenal Conservatism does not explicitly consider how memory's decay or distortion might affect the sufficiency of past appearances for current knowledge.**
