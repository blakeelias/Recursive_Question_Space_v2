**Consider a scenario where a person's belief about winning a competition becomes practically useful only because unexpected favorable conditions arise. Intuitively, their belief does not amount to knowledge despite its practical success.**, **It is implausible to maintain that knowledge can hinge on unforeseeable external circumstances that contribute to practical success.
