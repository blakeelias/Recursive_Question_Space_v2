**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is justified based on another belief and so on infinitely. If foundationalism is correct, such cases cannot constitute knowledge, but it seems plausible that infinite chains could provide justification.**, **Consider a scenario in which an infinite mathematical proof is understood incrementally. Intuitively, the understanding seems justified and knowledgeable without foundational stopping points.**, **It is implausible that all beliefs must terminate in foundational beliefs to avoid regress, as some chains of reasoning could be valid indefinitely.**
