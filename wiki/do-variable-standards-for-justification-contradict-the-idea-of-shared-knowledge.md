**Suppose we have a case in which a community requires different justification standards for the same knowledge claim in local versus global contexts, like a local belief versus a widely accepted scientific fact. Intuitively, if these standards lead to different outcomes in knowledge claims, it seems contradictory to hold that knowledge can truly be shared across different contexts.**, **There is a plausible principle that shared knowledge implies a common standard of justification. This principle combined with variable standards suggests an inconsistency in the possibility of holding shared knowledge.**
