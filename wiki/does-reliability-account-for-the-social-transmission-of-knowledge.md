**Suppose we have a case in which a person acquires a belief from another person who knows the proposition through a reliable cognitive process, such as a teacher communicating facts. Intuitively, we either must say the learner knows the proposition because it originated in a reliable process or that they do not because their direct process lacks reliability.**, **The transmission of knowledge through social learning challenges the self-contained nature of individual reliable processes as a sufficient condition for personal knowledge.**
