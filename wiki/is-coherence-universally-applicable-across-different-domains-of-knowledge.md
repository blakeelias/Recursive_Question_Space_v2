## Content

**Suppose we have a case of mathematical knowledge, where proofs and logical deductions provide certainty independently of a coherent system of other beliefs. Intuitively, coherence seems less relevant here.**, **There is a plausible principle that the nature of certain domains, like mathematics, requires criteria for knowledge that transcend mere coherence with a system of beliefs.**
