## Content

**Suppose a situation where an individual's belief occurs due to a reliable causal chain, but the belief lacks proper justification understood as epistemically warranted reasons.**, **There seems to be an intuition that knowledge requires not only truth and causation but also epistemic justification.**, **This suggests that simply having a true belief on grounds of causal chains does not fulfill the intuitive notion of knowing.**
