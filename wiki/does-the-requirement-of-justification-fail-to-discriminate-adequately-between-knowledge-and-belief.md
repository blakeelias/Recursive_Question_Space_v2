## Content

**Consider a scenario where two individuals each believe a true proposition; one has strong evidence (justification) while the other guesses correctly without evidence. Intuitively, only the person with justification should count as having knowledge.**, **A necessary account of knowledge should distinguish between cases where reliable evidence supports belief and cases where belief occurs without evidence.**, **A scenario can exist where both beliefs turn out to be true, but intuitively, the mere guess should not be regarded as knowledge, questioning the sufficiency of justification in discriminating knowledge.**
