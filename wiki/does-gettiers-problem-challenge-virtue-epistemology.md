**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a broken clock that coincidentally shows the correct time and forms a true belief that it is noon. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it is noon even though they meet the conditions of belief and truth.**, **In this scenario, intuitively, the person's belief does not arise from an exercise of intellectual virtue because it was based on luck.**
