**There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be objective and should not vary based on subjective factors like context.**, **If the standards for justification vary depending on context, then whether someone knows something can depend on arbitrary contextual factors.**, **It is implausible that such arbitrary contextual factors should determine whether someone knows something, as this undermines the objectivity of knowledge.**
