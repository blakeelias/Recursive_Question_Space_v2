**In a scenario where two individuals, E and F, have a disagreement about whether a proposition is known, the disagreements should be resolvable through facts or evidence.**, **With varying justification standards, each individual might appeal to different contextual standards, making it difficult to resolve the disagreement.**, **If contextualism permits both parties to be correct due to differing contexts, it could undermine the role of evidence and fact in settling knowledge claims.**
