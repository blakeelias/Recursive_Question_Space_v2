**Suppose David believes the light in the room is on because he flipped a switch and sees light. However, it’s actually on due to a generator fault. Although his belief is justified (he flipped the switch and sees light) and true (the light is on), the missing causal connection (his action didn’t cause the light) suggests, intuitively, that David does not know the light is on because of his action.**
