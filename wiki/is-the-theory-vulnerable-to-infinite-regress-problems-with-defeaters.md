## Content

**Consider a case where within each piece of justification, further hidden defeaters may be perpetually uncovered, creating an infinite regress.**, **Such an infinite regress of defeaters makes it logically impossible to ascertain any kind of knowledge.**, **Without a stopping point, the search for defeaters becomes unworkable, challenging the coherence of the requirement to lack defeaters.**
