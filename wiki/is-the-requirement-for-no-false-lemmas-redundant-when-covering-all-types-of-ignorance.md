## Content

**Suppose another plausible principle is that if a person has sufficient evidence and justification, the absence of false lemmas adds no new element to the justification for their belief. This principle suggests that the absence of false lemmas alone does not contribute significantly to distinguishing knowledge.**, **If sufficiency of evidence inherently precludes false lemmas, then distinguishing knowledge solely on 'No False Lemmas' may lack practical import.**
