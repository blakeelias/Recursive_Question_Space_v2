## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which scholars explore concepts beyond current applications, such as quantum physics theories**, **Intuitively, possessing an understanding of these concepts is considered knowledge, even if they are not yet practically useful**, **If practical usefulness is a requirement for all knowledge, then knowledge in dynamic fields is wrongly constrained**
