## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person is biased yet uses rigorous scientific methods leading to an unfounded belief in a coincidentally true proposition. Intuitively, the exercise of intellectual virtue is compromised by bias, leading to unjustified belief.**, **A plausible principle states that intellectual bias undermines justification. This principle, together with the occurrence of true belief, suggests that intellectual virtues can mislead without proper justification.**
