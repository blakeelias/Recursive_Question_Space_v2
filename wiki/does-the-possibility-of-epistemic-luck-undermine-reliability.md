**Imagine a situation where a person's true belief arises from a reliable process, yet aspects like timing or rare chance play a significant role in the truth of the belief. Intuitively, such involvement of epistemic luck suggests the absence of genuine knowledge.**, **Reliability presupposes a systematic and consistent output of true beliefs, but the presence of luck introduces elements of unpredictability.**, **If a belief's truth partially results from lucky circumstances, the reliability of the process is overshadowed by factors beyond control, which impacts its knowledge status.**
