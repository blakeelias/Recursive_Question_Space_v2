**Consider a scenario where a person P forms a belief that a landscape is a particular way, based solely on an inaccurate map, but it turns out the landscape is exactly as depicted on the map. Intuitively, we would judge that P does not know how the landscape is shaped, despite having a justified true belief.**, **A scenario in which a belief is based on a faulty instrument that unexpectedly reports the truth is a scenario in which the individual has a justified true belief but lacks knowledge.**
