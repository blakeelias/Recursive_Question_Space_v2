**Consider a case in which a person's beliefs about history are coherent yet derived entirely from inaccurate personal diaries without external verification. Intuitively, we judge that knowledge must be externally corroborated, not solely internally coherent.**, **There is a plausible principle that verification against authoritative sources is necessary for knowledge. This principle implies internal coherence alone cannot suffice where external verification is absent.**
