**Suppose a person believes that a scientific theory is correct because a renowned scientist says so, which provides justification, and it is true. If the person lacks understanding of why it is true or the science behind it, intuitively they do not possess knowledge.**, **Consider an individual who believes a language rule is correct because a language app confirms it, giving them justification.
