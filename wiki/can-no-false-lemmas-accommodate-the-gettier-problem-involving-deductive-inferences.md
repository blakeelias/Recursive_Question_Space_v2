## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person deduces a true conclusion from a false lemma with the true conclusion arrived at through a logical deduction. Intuitively, such cases are ones where we would hesitate to claim that the conclusion is known since it is inferred from a false assumption.**, **A scenario where a person deduces from a false lemma but arrives at a true conclusion through valid logic challenges the idea that dismissing false lemmas always secures knowledge.**
