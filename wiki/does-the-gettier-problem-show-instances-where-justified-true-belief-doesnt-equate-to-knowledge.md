**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified belief that a friend owns a Ford because of strong evidence like seeing them drive it. However, unbeknownst to them, the friend sold it but then borrowed another Ford. Intuitively, even if the belief is true, it was a result of coincidence and not knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that accidental truths undermine the conversion of justified true belief into knowledge, as evidenced by classic Gettier cases.**
