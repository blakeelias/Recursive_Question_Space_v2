## Content

**Suppose we consider a case where a person follows inaccurate reasoning that coincidentally leads to a true belief. Intuitively, we have to say that this is not knowledge because the element of luck undermines the justification requirement for knowledge.**, **It is necessary for knowledge that justification connects appropriately with truth, excluding scenarios where a true belief is arrived at by luck, which fails to constitute knowledge.**
