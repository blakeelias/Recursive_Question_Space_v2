## Content

**Imagine a case where a detective believes a person is guilty based on misleading evidence, yet the person truly committed the crime. Intuitively, this conviction does not qualify as knowledge, as the detective's methodology was flawed.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should arise from sound reasoning or evidence-based paths even when a factual conclusion is reached.**
