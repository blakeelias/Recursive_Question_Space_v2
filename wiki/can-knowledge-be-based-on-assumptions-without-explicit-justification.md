**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition primarily because an authority figure they trust said it was true. The person has not independently verified the claim or has explicit evidence for it. Intuitively, this scenario does not meet the stringent requirement for justification despite the proposition being true.**, **A theoretical principle suggests that for a person to know a proposition, their belief should have direct and explicit justification rather than reliance on another person's authority. This principle challenges cases where the justification element is satisfied in practice but not explicitly demonstrated consciously by the believer.**
