## Content

**Consider a scenario where two people arrive at a true belief, one through methodical skill and the other through a similar skill, but less rigorously applied. Intuitively, we distinguish between varying excellences even if resulting beliefs are the same, suggesting apt belief might not capture nuanced differences in epistemic competence that contribute to defining what is known**, **A plausible principle is that distinctive gradations in skill are important in evaluating what deserves the status of knowledge, challenging apt belief's potential uniformity**
