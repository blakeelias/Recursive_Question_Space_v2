**A mathematical truth like '2+2=4' does not change and thus has no causal relation with a belief formed in time.**, **If a causal link is required for such knowledge, then necessary, atemporal truths would not be knowable.**, **Intuition suggests that we clearly know mathematical and logical truths despite the absence of causal links.**
