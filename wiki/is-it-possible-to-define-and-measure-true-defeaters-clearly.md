## Content

**It is implausible that there is a precise way to define true defeaters, given variability in contexts and subjective interpretations of information.**, **Suppose we have a case where it's contentious whether new information really defeats a justification. Intuitively, the lack of clarity makes the criterion for absence of true defeaters problematic.**
