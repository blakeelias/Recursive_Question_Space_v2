# Does the requirement for infinite reasons conflict with the closure of knowledge under known deduction?

**Node Type:** antithesis

**Parent:** [Infinitism](infinitism.md)

## Content

**Closure under known deduction implies that if one knows a set of propositions and logically deduces another proposition, one knows the deduced proposition. If infinite reasons are needed for justification, this undermines the closure, as infinite extension is not practical for deduced knowledge.**, **Suppose we know individual premises through finite reasons and derive conclusions through valid deduction. Intuitively, we accept conclusions as known, suggesting that extending beyond finite reasons disrupts closure.**
