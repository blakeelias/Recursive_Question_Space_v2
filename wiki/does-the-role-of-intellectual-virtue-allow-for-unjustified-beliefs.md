## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief through what is considered an intellectual virtue, such as creative insight, but without supporting evidence. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person lacks justification or that knowledge requires more than intellectual virtue alone.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires justified true belief, and the role of intellectual virtue must coincide with evidential support to ensure justification.**, **Relying on intellectual virtue alone for knowledge allows for beliefs that may be unjustified in the absence of supporting evidence.**
