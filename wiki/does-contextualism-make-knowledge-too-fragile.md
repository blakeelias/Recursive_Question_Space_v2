## Content

**A robust theory of knowledge should ensure that people maintain knowledge despite minor changes in context.**, **Suppose the justification standards shift slightly in two similar contexts, A and B, but the person does not change anything else about themselves. Intuitively, they should still know the same proposition in both contexts.**, **If in one context a proposition is known but in the other it is not, due to varying standards, then knowledge becomes fragile and unstable.**
