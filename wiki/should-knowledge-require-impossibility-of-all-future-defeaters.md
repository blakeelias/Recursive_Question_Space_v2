## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has justified belief in a true proposition, but new future evidence could potentially act as a defeater. Intuitively, it seems incorrect to claim that the person lacks knowledge now simply because future discoveries might change their status.**, **It is implausible to expect knowledge to involve resilience against all possible future defeaters, as this would make knowledge contingent on unpredictable future conditions.**
