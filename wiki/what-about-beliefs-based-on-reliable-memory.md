## Content

**Consider a case where a person remembers a past event accurately. The causal link between the belief and the past event might be tenuous or blurred due to time, yet it intuitively seems like the person knows the event happened.**, **We must allow that memory, even with a weak causal link, can result in knowledge, thereby challenging the need for a strong causal connection.**
