## Content

**Consider a case where a person forms a belief which is true and justified according to their evidence, but this belief results from an unreliable cognitive process prone to error. Intuitively, such a belief does not seem to count as knowledge despite being true and justified.**, **Justification might not be sufficient for knowledge if the process of belief formation lacks reliability, implying the necessity of a reliable cognitive process for knowledge that goes beyond just avoiding false lemmas.**
