## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence that later turns out to be misleading, but unbeknownst to them, the proposition is still true. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **In this situation, the justification for the belief is considered to have a true defeater, as new information undermines the original evidence for the belief.**, **If a justified false belief that is still true intuitively seems not to qualify as knowledge, this suggests a flaw in requiring justification that simply has no defeaters rather than no true defeaters.**
