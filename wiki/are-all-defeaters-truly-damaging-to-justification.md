## Content

**Consider a scenario where person A justifiably believes a true proposition supported by strong evidence, but an intuitive yet false alternative explanation (a defeater) is proposed by person B causing doubt. In this scenario, person A's knowledge should remain intact despite false defeaters affecting their justification.**, **A plausible principle is that only true and relevant defeaters should plausibly affect knowledge. Defeaters that are false or irrelevant should not necessarily undermine justification or knowledge.**
