**Suppose a person believes a true proposition and has strong justification supported by various facts they assume are correct. Intuitively, we might judge they have knowledge.**, **If even minor falsehoods exist in the supporting assumptions, the 'no false lemmas' condition suggests they do not have knowledge, despite the true belief and justification.**
