## Content

**The exercise of intellectual virtue may depend on the context in which the belief is formed, such as cultural or social settings that influence what is considered virtuous. Intuitively, depending on context implies a lack of uniform criteria for establishing knowledge.**, **Intellectual virtues can be perceived differently across various cultures, suggesting flexibility in their necessity for establishing knowledge, which conflicts with a strict criterion of intellectual virtue.**
