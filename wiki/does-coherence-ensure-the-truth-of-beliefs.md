## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person's belief about a medical treatment coheres with their broader beliefs about health without any empirical validation. Intuitively, either the belief about the treatment is considered true purely due to coherence, or additional justification is needed. If coherence alone suffices, then misleading beliefs could be erroneously considered knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that coherence does not necessarily entail empirical verification. This principle implies that a belief could cohere well with other beliefs yet still be false if not supported by empirical evidence.**
