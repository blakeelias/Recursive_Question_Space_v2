**Imagine a person who uses faulty reasoning to conclude correctly that a suspect is guilty, though their process involves no false steps or lemmas. Intuitively, their belief should not be considered knowledge because it resulted from flawed reasoning, not from any false assumptions.**, **A logically faulty reasoning process that nevertheless yields a true belief complicates the connection between the avoidance of false lemmas and the achievement of knowledge.**
