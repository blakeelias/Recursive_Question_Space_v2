**Consider a scenario where a person wins the lottery and knows they have won because they read it on the official lottery website. The website is correctly reporting their win, but the belief is not derived from or causally linked to the actual draw. Intuitively, one might say the person knows they won.**, **This case suggests that a person can have knowledge even if there is no direct causal connection between the belief and the fact itself, as the belief is true and justified through reliable media.**
