## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person employs their intellectual virtue, such as careful reasoning or good judgment, but still arrives at a false belief due to misleading evidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, as the belief is not true.**, **The necessity of a true belief implies that the involvement of intellectual virtues is not sufficient for knowledge, as true beliefs may still be absent.**
