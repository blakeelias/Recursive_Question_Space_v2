## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition and has justification for it, and it is true, but there is an unknown true fact that would undermine this justification if it were known. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not require the absence of unknown true defeaters. This principle together with the idea that someone can have knowledge even if there are unknown true defeaters challenges the necessity of the absence of true defeaters for knowledge.**
