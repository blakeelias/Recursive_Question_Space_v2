## Content

**In practical decision-making, agents operate based on finite reasons and appear to reach knowledge in a useful sense. The necessity for infinite reasons conflicts with this notion of practical knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge required for decision-making should not involve processing an infinite number of reasons. This challenges the necessity of infinite chains under certain practical contexts.**
