**Consider a scenario where a person exercises meticulous reasoning and intellectual humility in a field where the best current theories are later proven incorrect.

Intuitively, it seems incorrect to attribute knowledge where the primary condition—truth—does not hold.**, **There is a plausible principle that while intellectual virtue increases the likelihood of acquiring knowledge, it is not infallible and cannot guarantee the possession of knowledge.**
