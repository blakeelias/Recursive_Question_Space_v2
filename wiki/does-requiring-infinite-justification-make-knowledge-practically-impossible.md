## Content

**A finite human mind cannot process an infinite chain of reasons. If an infinite chain of reasons is necessary for justification, it follows that humans cannot have knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where someone constructs a long but finite chain of reasoning to justify a belief in a straightforward proposition. Intuitively, we would judge that adding more reasons does not enhance their knowledge but burdens it needlessly.**
