**Imagine a person has a justified belief in a true proposition but also has access to misleading evidence, which, if believed, would serve as a false defeater. Despite the false defeater's presence, we might still say they have knowledge if they correctly ignore the misleading evidence.**, **False defeaters can complicate the justificatory landscape without necessarily destroying knowledge, suggesting true defeaters are not uniquely necessary threats to knowledge.**
