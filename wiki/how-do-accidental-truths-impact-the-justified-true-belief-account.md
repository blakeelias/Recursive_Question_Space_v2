## Content

**Suppose someone has a justified belief in a true proposition, where justification is based on an accident or incorrect assumption that appears accurate. In such a case, despite the proposition being true and justified, intuition might deny it as knowledge.**, **Someone infers the truth of a proposition based on an error in their reasoning that accidentally aligns with reality, creating the impression of true justified belief without actual knowledge.**
