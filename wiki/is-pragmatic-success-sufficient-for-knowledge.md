## Content

**Consider a person who believes in a lucky charm that does not causally contribute to success but coincides with successful outcomes. Intuitively, we may see the belief as practically useful but not as knowledge.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief proves to be practically useful or successful.**, **It is implausible that the mere practical success of a belief must mean the belief constitutes knowledge.**
