## Content

**There may be unknown or unforeseeable defeaters that contradict a person's justification for a belief.**, **If these unknown defeaters exist, a person cannot have knowledge because their justification could potentially be defeated.**, **Since we cannot know all potential defeaters, it is implausible that knowledge can require justification free of true defeaters.**
