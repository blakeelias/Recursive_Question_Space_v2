**Consider a scenario where a person reads a reliable newspaper saying a politician won an election, believes it, and it is true only because the counted votes were tampered but the politician actually won legitimately. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the election result despite having a justified true belief.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could be attributed to someone if the justification for their true belief does not properly connect them to the fact in a reliable or robust manner.**
