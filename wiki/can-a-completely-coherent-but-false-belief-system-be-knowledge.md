**There is a plausible principle that knowledge also requires a true connection to the world beyond mere coherence. This principle suggests a completely coherent but false belief system cannot constitute knowledge.**, **Consider a case of religious or conspiracy belief systems that are internally coherent but empirically unfounded.
