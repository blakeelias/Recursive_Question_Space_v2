## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual believes a true proposition based on a lucky guess with no causal connection between the belief and the proposition. Intuitively, we would hesitate to say the individual has knowledge.**, **It is plausible that a person can have a true belief that turns out to be correct due to chance or coincidence, undermining the requirement for a causal connection.**
