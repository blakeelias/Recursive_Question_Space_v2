**Reflective knowledge involves having access to reasons or justifications for beliefs, whereas animal knowledge simply involves forming beliefs based on reliable processes. Reliabilism does not account for this intuitive differentiation between these two types of knowledge.**, **Consider a person who forms true beliefs through reliable processes but lacks awareness or understanding of why their beliefs are reliable. We intuitively understand there is a difference between such a case and one where a person comprehends the reliability of the process.**
