## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person acquires a true belief through sheer luck, absent any intellectual virtue or active cognitive effort, such as spontaneously guessing the outcome of an unpredictable event like a coin toss accurately. Intuitively, we might say that although they have the true belief, attributing knowledge feels inappropriate in this context.**, **There is a plausible principle that links knowledge to intellectual agency, suggesting that true belief formed without intellectual virtue lacks the robust grounding needed for knowledge.**
