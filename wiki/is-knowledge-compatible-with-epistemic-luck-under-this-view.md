**Epistemic luck concerns cases where a person's belief is true by chance rather than through skillful inquiry.**, **When a belief is true by chance, it may lack aptness, as it is not based on skill or reliable processes.**, **If epistemic luck results in true beliefs, this compromises the necessity of aptness for knowledge as proposed by the view.**
