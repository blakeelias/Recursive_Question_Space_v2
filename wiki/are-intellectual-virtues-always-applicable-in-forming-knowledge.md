## Content

**Suppose we examine a case where external circumstances or events hinder the application of intellectual virtues, such as in high-pressure decisions where quick judgments are necessary without time for contemplation. Intuitively, we still might consider some of these immediate judgments as constituting knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that certain life circumstances necessitate belief formation without an exercise of intellectual virtue, yet these beliefs can still rise to the level of knowledge.**
