## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a coherent set of beliefs formed entirely by a random number generator. Intuitively, we would not call this knowledge because the beliefs are not formed in a truth-conducive way.**, **There is a plausible principle that a process leading to knowledge should be reliable. This principle suggests that mere coherence does not ensure reliability or truth.**
