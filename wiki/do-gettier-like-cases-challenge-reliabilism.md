**In Gettier cases, someone has justified true beliefs that accidentally turn out to be true because of misleading evidence, such as believing their colleague owns a particular car based on seeing them drive a similar rented one.**, **Although the belief is true and formed through a generally reliable process of inference, the involvement of accidental truth seems to undermine the notion of genuine knowledge.**, **These scenarios suggest that reliability might not adequately address issues of justified true belief where luck plays a role in the belief's accuracy.**
