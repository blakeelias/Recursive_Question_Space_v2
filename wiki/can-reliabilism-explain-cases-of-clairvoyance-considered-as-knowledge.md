**Consider a scenario where a person named Samantha has a reliable clairvoyant ability, unknown to her, that reliably provides true beliefs about distant events. Intuitively, we would judge that Samantha does not have knowledge because she has no reason to trust her clairvoyance.**, **Intuitively, even reliable processes might fail to produce knowledge if the believer has no access to or understanding of the reliability.**
