**Consider a situation where someone forms a belief that it will rain based on faulty weather equipment; the belief is true, but for atmospheric reasons unknown to them. Intuitively, they lack full knowledge as the belief's accuracy is incidental.**, **It is implausible that a true belief, correct purely by situational coincidence, should count as knowledgeable unless appropriately connected to reliable evidence or process.**
