**Consider a scenario where a person believes a clock is giving the correct time, their justification is based on the clock normally being reliable, and it so happens to be the correct time, although the clock had stopped 24 hours ago. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge even though they have a justified true belief.**, **For a definition of knowledge to be adequate, it must account for cases where justified true belief is present, but ordinary intuitions do not count it as knowledge.**
