## Content

**Suppose a person witnesses an event, such as a car accident, but later loses memory of the event due to amnesia, although they were asked immediately after and accurately reported it. Despite having once had a causal link with the event, the memory loss severs the direct causal connection to their belief at a later time.**, **Cases where amnesia or other neurological deficits interrupt the memory of an event challenge the necessity of maintaining a continuous causal link for the knowledge claim to hold.**
