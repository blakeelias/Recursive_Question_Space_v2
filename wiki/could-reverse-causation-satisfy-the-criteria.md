## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person forms a belief due to reading an oracle. Coincidentally, the oracleâ€™s prediction causes the event to occur, creating a reverse causal link between the belief and the truth. Intuitively, the person does not have knowledge.**, **The idea that knowledge requires a specific direction of causation indicates that just any causal link, especially when reverse, is insufficient for knowledge.**
