**Consider a mathematician deriving a true theorem using a proof technique that involves sophisticated false premises simplifications.**, **The mathematician's belief in the theorem is justified based on their expertise and the broader reliability of mathematical proofs.**, **The premise simplifications, though false, do not affect the theorem itself being valid, suggesting that false assumptions can sometimes be disentangled from the truth of a justified belief.**
