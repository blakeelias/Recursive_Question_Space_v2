## Content

**For finite beings existing within time, constructing or comprehending an infinite chain is impossible. If an infinite chain is necessary for justification, then temporally bound agents can never truly know anything.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be achievable within an agent's lifetime. This principle together with the need for infinite justification suggests an inconsistency.**
