## Content

**Consider a Gettier-style case where a person has a justified true belief that coheres with their other beliefs yet arrives at the truth through luck. Intuitively, this person does not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge cannot be based on mere coincidence, even if the belief is justified and true. This principle challenges coherentism, which may not prevent false positives in such scenarios.**
