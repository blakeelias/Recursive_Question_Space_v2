## Content

**An apt belief involves accuracy derived from cognitive abilities, but this notion may either exclude valid instances of knowledge or encompass mistaken ones due to how broadly cognitive abilities are interpreted.**, **A concept of aptness that is too narrowly defined could exclude cognitive feats that do arrive at truth, whereas a too broad definition might sweep in beliefs that are not securely aimed at truth, posing a challenge to clarity in defining knowledge.**, **An accurate and well-formed belief might still rely on fortuitous intellectual moments not commonly seen as stable evidence of cognitive abilities, questioning either strict or wide interpretations of aptness.**
