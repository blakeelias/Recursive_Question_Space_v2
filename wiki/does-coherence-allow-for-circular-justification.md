## Content

**There is a plausible principle that justification for a belief ought to prevent circular reasoning. However, coherence with other beliefs in a system may permit circular justification, which intuitively does not provide proper grounds for knowledge.**, **Suppose we have a case in which belief A is justified by belief B, and belief B by belief A, creating a coherent system. Intuitively, neither A nor B seems justified based on circularity.**
