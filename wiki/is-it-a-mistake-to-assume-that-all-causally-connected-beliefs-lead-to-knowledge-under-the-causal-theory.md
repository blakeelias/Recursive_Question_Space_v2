## Content

**Consider a person who believes a specific political prediction because of a complex but unreliable algorithm related to genuine outcomes by chance. Intuitively, the person lacks knowledge due to unreliability despite a causal link present.**, **It is implausible that chance-based causation reliably results in knowledge, indicating that pure causal connections without a reliability component may fail to constitute knowledge.**
