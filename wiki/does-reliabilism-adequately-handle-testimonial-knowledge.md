**Consider a scenario where an individual acquires a true belief based solely on the testimony of a normally reliable friend who, on this occasion, is misinformed but accidentally correct. Intuitively, we would hesitate to call this knowledge because the reliability of the source on this occasion isn't clear.**, **There is a plausible principle that testimony involves complex interactions of belief and credibility that a strict reliance on general reliability fails to address. This principle sheds doubt on the reliance on reliability as an adequate framework for testimonial knowledge.**
