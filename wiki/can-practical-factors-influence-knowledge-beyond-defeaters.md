## Content

**Imagine a situation where a person's belief in a true proposition, with no defeaters, is influenced by high practical stakes. Intuitively, stakes affect whether we consider the person to truly know the proposition, questioning whether the absence of defeaters alone suffices for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge is sensitive to practical stakes, implying that the absence of defeaters is not a sufficient condition for knowledge.**
