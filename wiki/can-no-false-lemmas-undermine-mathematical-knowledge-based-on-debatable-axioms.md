## Content

**Assume a mathematician believes a new theorem using a widely accepted set of axioms that some argue might be false. Intuitively, until proven otherwise, the theorem counts as knowledge.**, **The presence of potentially false assumptions in the axioms challenges the 'no false lemmas' condition, which would disqualify knowledge oppressively.**
