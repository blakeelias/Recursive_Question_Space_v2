## Content

**Consider a situation where an individual continuously applies intellectual virtues to validate their own knowledge claims, such as endlessly questioning the justification of their belief in each inferential step without reaching a satisfactory foundation. Intuitively, this leads to an infinite regress where knowledge might never be conclusively attained.**, **It is implausible for a system of knowledge based on intellectual virtue to entirely circumvent the traditional problem of regress without requiring some foundational beliefs to remain unchecked.**
