## Content

**Suppose that in one context high standards are required for justification, and in another, lower standards suffice.**, **Intuitively, we must accept that a knowledge claim can be validated in the lower-standard context but negated in the higher-standard context.**, **It is implausible that the same knowledge claim can be both valid and invalid based purely on context, as this creates contradictions in knowledge attributions.**
