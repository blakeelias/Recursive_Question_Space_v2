## Content

**Many animals are seen to possess knowledge, such as knowing where to find food or how to navigate a territory, without being capable of constructing infinite reasons.**, **Animal knowledge appears grounded in finite, repeatable experiences and instincts, not in an infinite regress.**, **If animals can be said to have knowledge, the requirement for infinite reasons must be reconsidered or it rules out all non-human knowledge.**
