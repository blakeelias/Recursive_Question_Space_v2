## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alice, looks at a clock that stopped exactly 24 hours ago. The clock shows the correct time, and Alice forms the true belief about the time based on this. Intuitively, Alice does not have knowledge about the current time, even though her belief is true and she has justification in the form of the clock's display.**, **The scenario demonstrates that even if belief, justification, and truth coincidentally align, the process by which the truth is attained might not be reliable, undermining the sufficiency claim for knowledge.**
