## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a true defeater exists, but it is irrelevant or harmless to the justification of the belief. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that not all true defeaters undermine knowledge, especially if they have no practical impact on the justification or truth of the belief.**
