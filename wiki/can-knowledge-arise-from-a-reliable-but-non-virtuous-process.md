**A person can form a belief about a proposition through a reliable but non-virtuous process, such as a computer randomly generating numbers that happen to yield true results. In such a case, intuitively the person does not know the proposition, though their belief is true.**, **A personâ€™s belief can be formed by a mechanism which is reliable without the person exercising any form of intellectual virtue, displaying no effort or engagement. Intuitively, this does not confer knowledge upon the person even if the belief is true.**
