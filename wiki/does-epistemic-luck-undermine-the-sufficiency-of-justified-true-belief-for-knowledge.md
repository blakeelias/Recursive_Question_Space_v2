**Consider a situation where a meteorologist, Jack, predicts rain based on a weather model that is accurate only by sheer coincidence, as the conventional and reliable data was tampered with. Jack's prediction turns out to be true and aligns with his model, giving him a justified true belief. Intuitively, Jack does not have knowledge about the weather, pointing instead to randomness rather than good epistemic method.**, **This shows that epistemic luck can intervene between justification and truth, rendering the culmination of belief, truth, and justification insufficient to constitute knowledge.**
