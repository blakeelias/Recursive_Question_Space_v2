**Consider a person who has extensively researched a historical event, forming a true belief, while there is a buried document unknown and inaccessible to anyone that contradicts this belief. We would still intuitively assert that the person's belief amounts to knowledge.**, **If defeaters, by nature inaccessible or detectable, can annul knowledge, it might suggest that knowledge is nearly unavoidable, contradicting our usual understanding.**
