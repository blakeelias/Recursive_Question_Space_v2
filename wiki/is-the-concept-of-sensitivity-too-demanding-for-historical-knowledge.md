## Content

**Take a case where a historian believes a proposition about an historical fact based on extensive research and supporting evidence.**, **Imagine this historical fact were false and either evidence was misleading or lost; intuitively, the historian might still believe the same proposition.**, **Sensitivity's demand that belief should not persist if the proposition were false seems too strict as it discounts justified knowledge of historical events due to their nature.**
