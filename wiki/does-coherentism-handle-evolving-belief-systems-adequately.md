## Content

**Belief systems can change over time, and new beliefs are sometimes inconsistent with previous beliefs that were part of a coherent system.**, **An evolving belief system that changes consistency over time might suggest that what is known can fluctuate based on current coherence, rather than fixed truth.**, **This poses a problem for coherentism as it suggests that knowledge is unstable and uncertain when belief systems evolve, potentially undermining the claim that current coherence guarantees knowledge.**
