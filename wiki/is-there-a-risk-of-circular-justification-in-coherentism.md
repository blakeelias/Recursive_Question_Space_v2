**In a coherentist system, it is possible for a belief to be justified by other beliefs that, in turn, derive their justification from the original belief, creating a potentially circular justification.**, **A person could justify their belief that antibiotics cure bacterial infections due to coherence with various medical beliefs, which themselves are justified solely by coherence with the original belief.**, **Circular justifications are problematic because they do not provide an independent basis of support for the beliefs in question.**
