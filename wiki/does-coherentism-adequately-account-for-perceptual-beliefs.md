**Perceptual beliefs, which are beliefs formed directly from sensory experience, are often seen as foundational to our understanding of the world.**, **Coherentism suggests that a belief must fit into an existing system, but this doesn't explain how new perceptual beliefs are justified or validated without reference to coherence with old beliefs.**, **By potentially underplaying the role of direct perceptual input, coherentism might inadequately explain how immediate sensory experiences contribute to knowledge.**
