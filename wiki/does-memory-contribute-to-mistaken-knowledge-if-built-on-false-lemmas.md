**People often remember past experiences and form beliefs based on these memories, even when some memories may contain inaccuracies that could be considered false lemmas.**, **These memory-based beliefs seem to retain a status of knowledge even if the original experiences were incomplete or partially incorrect.**, **If knowledge requires no false lemmas, then beliefs grounded in inaccurate memories would traditionally not qualify as knowledge, which seems counterintuitive.**
