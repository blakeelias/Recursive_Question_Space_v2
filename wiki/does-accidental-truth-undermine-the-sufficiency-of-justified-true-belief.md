## Content

**Consider a situation where a subject sees what appears to be a sheep in a field and forms the belief that there is a sheep in the field. They have justification because they see what looks like a sheep. Unbeknownst to them, they are actually looking at a cleverly disguised dog, but there is a real sheep hidden from view behind a bush. Intuitively, the person does not know there is a sheep in the field, despite having a justified true belief.**
