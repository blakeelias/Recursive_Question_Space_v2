## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person acts perfectly in line with a true proposition without explicit conscious belief in it. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person has knowledge of how to act even without an explicit belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that awareness or implicit knowledge can occur without explicit belief. This principle together with the necessary condition for belief entails that explicit belief may not always be required for practical success.**
