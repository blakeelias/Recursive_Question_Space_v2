## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief that it will rain tomorrow purely by random guesswork. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not know it will rain, as their belief is not based on intellectual virtue but rather luck.**, **Suppose we have a case where a person has a justified true belief based solely on common sense—such as touching a hot stove and immediately withdrawing from it—not exercising any specific intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we might say the person knows that the stove is hot due to common sense awareness.**
