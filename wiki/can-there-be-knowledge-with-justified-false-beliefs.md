## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition and has very strong justification for it, but one of their justifying reasons is actually false. Intuitively, we still consider the person to know the proposition.**, **A principle suggests that strong justification for a belief, even if partially based on falsehoods, can still constitute knowledge when the belief is true and relevant reasoning is not undermined by the falsehood.**
