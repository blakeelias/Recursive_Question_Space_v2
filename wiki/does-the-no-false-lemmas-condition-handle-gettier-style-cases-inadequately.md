## Content

**Consider a case where a person sees a stopped clock that happens to read the correct time, leading them to believe the time is correct. Intuitively, this is not knowledge as their belief is lucky.**, **The belief is not based directly on any false lemma, just an unusual coincidence, so 'no false lemmas' alone may not adequately separate knowledge from lucky true belief.**
