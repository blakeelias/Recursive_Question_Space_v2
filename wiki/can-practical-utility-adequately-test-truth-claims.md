## Content

**A belief can be practically useful or successful even if it is false, as in cases where false beliefs lead to beneficial outcomes, such as believing in a placebo's healing power causing a health improvement**, **Practical success or utility does not necessarily correlate with truth, as utility can be context-dependent and vary across different circumstances and individuals**
