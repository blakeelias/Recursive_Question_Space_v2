## Content

**It is plausible to suppose that there are justified beliefs which do not result in knowledge due to factors beyond the believer's control.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has a justified belief based on reliable evidence but unknowingly encounters a Gettier case, where their justified belief turns out to be true merely by chance. In such a scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge, yet their belief was justified.**
