**Suppose there is someone who wrongly assumes a friend is present because they see their familiar-looking car when the friend is indeed elsewhere, but the friend unexpectedly teleports next to them. Intuitively, it feels incorrect to say this person knew their friend was present initially.**, **Forming a correct belief based on an irrelevant false datum might challenge the intuition of knowledge even if no false lemmas directly influence the final belief.**
