**Consider a scenario where a person routinely identifies the colors of objects around them without conscious reflection or exercise of specific intellectual virtues, yet forms true beliefs. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the colors of the objects without exercising intellectual virtues.**, **It is implausible to claim that intellectual virtue must be actively exercised in mundane, everyday cases of acquiring knowledge.**
