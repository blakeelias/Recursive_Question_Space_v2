## Content

**In cases where a person uses a generally reliable process to form beliefs, but there is no direct causal link to a specific true belief, it challenges whether the belief counts as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person uses a horoscope to believe true propositions about the future. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not have knowledge, even if their belief is true.**, **Reliance on a process that is generally unreliable, yet accidentally true in this instance, does not establish an appropriate causal connection between belief and truth.**
