## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if someone reliably uses intellectual virtues to form a belief, and this process typically leads to true beliefs, their belief should count as knowledge. This principle together with the existence of cases where reliable processes accidentally lead to a true belief, such as believing there is a fire due to seeing smoke when it is actually from a barbecue nearby, entails that reliability alone may not suffice for knowledge.**, **Consider a case where someone forms a true belief about the time because they hear a clock striking noon, when in fact, the clock is broken and coincidentally strikes at the correct time. Intuitively, this case should not be considered knowledge even if hearing the clock is usually a reliable method.**
