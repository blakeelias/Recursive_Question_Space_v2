**It is implausible that every belief can be justified by other beliefs in an infinite regress. This suggests the need for foundational beliefs that coherentism does not account for.**, **Consider a scenario in which each belief in a set justifies the next without end. Intuitively, such an infinite regress does not provide a satisfactory justification for the original belief.**
