**Suppose there is an epistemic practice where individuals appeal to a 'shifting justification threshold' based on conversational context. If knowledge claims accept variable justification thresholds, distinguishing between true and false beliefs could be context-dependent rather than objective.**, **If knowledge can be true in one context and false in another without any change in the objective truth of the belief, then what is subject to knowledge can become a matter of linguistic or subjective context sensitivity, making objective claims about knowledge seem unreliable.**, **An objective account of knowledge seems to require more stable criteria for justification beyond merely contextual standards, to avoid making knowledge truth claim something other than just semantics.**
