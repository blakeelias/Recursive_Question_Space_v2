## Content

**Suppose a person has a justified true belief about a historical fact, based on expert consensus, but new evidence that they are unaware of contradicts this.**, **Intuitively, the personâ€™s lack of awareness about the emerging evidence does not seem to affect the validity of their knowledge at the time prior to the discovery.**, **Knowledge should not be contingent on unknown potential defeaters, as these do not influence the person's epistemic circumstances at the time of knowing.**
