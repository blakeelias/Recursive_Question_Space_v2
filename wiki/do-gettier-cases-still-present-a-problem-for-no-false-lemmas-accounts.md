**Consider a scenario where someone believes a barn is real because they see it standing, but in the area, there is a history of fake barn facades. Even though the actual barn is real, the person's belief is accidentally true and based partly on false assumptions about the surroundings. Intuitively, the person doesn't have knowledge because their belief was not formed in a completely reliable manner.**, **A plausible principle suggests that the conditions for knowledge cannot always exclude every conceivable relevant falsehood, highlighting situations where 'No False Lemmas' fails to safeguard against accidental truths due to unrelated false beliefs.**
