## Content

**Suppose there was a point in time when a person's belief in a proposition depended on a false assumption, but later the belief is corrected and justified by true evidence. Intuitively, a historical falsehood may no longer impact current knowledge.**, **The transformation of a belief from previously false assumption reliance to full justification appears intuitively to restore its status as knowledge.**
