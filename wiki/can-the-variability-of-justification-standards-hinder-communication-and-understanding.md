**Imagine two individuals discussing a scientific topic but employing different standards of justification due to their contexts, like a layperson versus a scientist. Intuitively, such variability may lead to misunderstandings, as each person's claim to "know" reflects different justificatory thresholds.**, **There is a plausible concern that if justification standards vary widely without a common understanding, communication becomes troubled, making it challenging to have constructive or meaningful dialogues.**
