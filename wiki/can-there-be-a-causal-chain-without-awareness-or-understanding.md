## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief in a proposition through a complex chain of events they do not comprehend. Our intuition might fail to attribute knowledge due to lack of understanding.**, **It is plausible that knowledge involves an awareness or understanding of the connection between belief and truth, beyond just causality.**, **A mere causal connection that lacks transparency or intelligibility to the agent does not suffice for knowledge in an intuitive sense.**
