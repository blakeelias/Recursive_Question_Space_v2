## Content

**Consider a scenario in which someone correctly guesses the outcome of a die roll without any basis for their guess. Intuitively, we would not say they believe the proposition, but they have true knowledge of the outcome.**, **It is plausible that knowledge can sometimes occur without belief, as shown when someone acts on a correct intuitive judgment without conscious belief in the judgment itself.**
