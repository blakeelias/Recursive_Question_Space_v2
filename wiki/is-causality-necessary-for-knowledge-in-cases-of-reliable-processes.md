## Content

**Reliable cognitive processes, such as perception and memory, can produce beliefs that qualify as knowledge.**, **These processes might not involve a direct causal link between the proposition and the person's belief but instead involve systematic reliability.**, **An example includes acquiring knowledge through deductive reasoning from axioms without direct causation between the axioms and the conclusion.**
