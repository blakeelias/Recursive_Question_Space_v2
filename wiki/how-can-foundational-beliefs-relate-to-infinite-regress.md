**There is a plausible principle that a belief is justified by being either foundational or based on other justified beliefs. This principle together with the necessity for avoiding infinite regress entails that foundational beliefs act as arbitrary stopping points in justifying knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where each belief is justified by another belief, ad infinitum. Intuitively, this results in an infinite regress and needs to be halted by foundational beliefs.**
