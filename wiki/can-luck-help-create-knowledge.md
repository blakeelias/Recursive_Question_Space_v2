## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone accidentally deduces a truth from a faulty premise due to sheer luck, but they remain entirely unaware of the faults in their reasoning. Intuitively, it does not seem that this person truly knows what they have deduced, since luck plays too central a role in the acquisition of their belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude the possibility of accidental truths, as knowledge should arise from sound reasoning instead of being a product of chance.**
