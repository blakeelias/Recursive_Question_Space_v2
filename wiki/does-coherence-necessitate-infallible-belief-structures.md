**There is a plausible principle that if coherence required impeccable beliefs, instances of human error would significantly impede practical knowledge claims.**, **Consider a scenario in which a mathematician makes a small error in calculation that doesn't substantially disrupt the overall theoretical framework they propose. Intuitively, we might judge they still possess knowledge of the framework.**, **It is implausible that coherence must mean an absolute absence of errors, as this demand would eliminate functional knowledge in complex domains.**
