**There is a plausible principle that for someone to know something, they must be in a position where knowledge couldn't simply be faked by luck or accident. This principle together with the necessity of intellectual virtue entails that intellectual virtue alone is insufficient for knowledge.**, **One can imagine a scenario where a belief formed through intellectual virtue is accidentally true, such as hitting a true mark when shooting with closed eyes. Intuitively, this does not count as knowledge.**
