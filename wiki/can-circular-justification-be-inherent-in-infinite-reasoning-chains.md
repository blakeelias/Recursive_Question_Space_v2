## Content

**In complex chains of reasoning, circularity can be hidden or masked as part of an infinite series.**, **Even an infinite list can include implicit or unforeseen correlations that result in circularity.**, **If the possibility of circularity exists within infinite chains, it challenges the validity of infinite justifications as non-repeating.**
