**Consider a scenario where a person sees a broken clock that consistently shows the wrong time but is trusted by the person regardless. In such a scenario, intuitively we might believe that if the clock accidentally shows the correct time, the person lacks knowledge even if there are no false assumptions involved.**, **A person who believes the time shown by the broken clock without any false assumptions might seem to have knowledge if the time happens to be correct, yet we intuitively judge they do not truly know the time.**
