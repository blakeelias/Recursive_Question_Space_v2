**It is implausible that the knowledge of a proposition should change merely due to differences in contextual standards. Intuitively, this suggests that knowledge claims become unstable.**, **A stable system of knowledge should have fixed guidelines for when claims pass as knowledge, which varying standards disrupt. This need for stability in knowledge suggests a consistent standard is necessary.**
