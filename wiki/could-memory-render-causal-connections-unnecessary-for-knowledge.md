## Content

**Suppose a person remembers a true fact learned years ago but cannot recall how or why they learned it. Intuitively, we might still consider this as knowledge.**, **In cases of memory, the causal chain connecting a belief to the original proposition might be disrupted or forgotten, calling into question the necessity of a current causal connection.**
