## Content

**Consider a scenario where one belief coheres with minor, less significant beliefs but conflicts with major foundational ones. Intuitively, mere coherence with lesser beliefs does not result in knowledge of important issues.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires greater coherence with significant, foundational beliefs rather than just any coherent system.**
