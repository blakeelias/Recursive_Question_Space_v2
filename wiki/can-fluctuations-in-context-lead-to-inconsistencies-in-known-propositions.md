**Imagine a scenario where a person first claims to know a proposition under low-context standards and consistently applies these standards to everyday situations.**, **Consider a case where this same person is required to apply high-context standards in a rigorous academic scenario where the same proposition is scrutinized, leading them to withdraw the knowledge claim.**, **The inconsistency between claiming and withdrawing knowledge due to contextual changes indicates a potential issue with using variable standards for justification.**
