**Errors or misconceptions can exist within a coherent system of beliefs, leading to inconsistencies over time.**, **If a coherent system can contain errors, it challenges whether coherence alone can ascertain knowledge without additional mechanisms for error correction.**, **This raises a concern about the reliability of coherence as a criterion for true knowledge if error detection and correction are not part of the process.**
