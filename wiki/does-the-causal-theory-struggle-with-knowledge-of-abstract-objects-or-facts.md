## Content

**Consider the belief that mathematical propositions, such as "2 + 2 = 4", are true. These propositions exist independently of physical causal interactions. There is no clear causal connection to account for this kind of knowledge.**, **In such cases of mathematical knowledge, where a physical causal link is absent, it seems that one can still possess knowledge, posing a challenge to the causal theory.**
