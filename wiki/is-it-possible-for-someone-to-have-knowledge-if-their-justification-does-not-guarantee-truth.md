**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is to count as knowledge, its justification should make the truth of the belief highly likely. This principle suggests that merely avoiding false assumptions does not suffice for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person holds a belief with strong justification from a generally reliable source, but the source has coincidentally erred this time, and yet the belief is true. Intuitively, we may not consider this case as one of knowledge.**
