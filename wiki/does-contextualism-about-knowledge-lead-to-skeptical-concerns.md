**Consider a scenario where two individuals are in a low-stakes context where little is riding on whether they know a certain fact, such as the height of a building. In this context, they both claim to know the fact based on a quick glance and prior understanding. Intuitively, we might judge that they know this fact.**, **Contrast this with a high-stakes context where an architectural project depends on getting the building's height correct. Now, the same individuals doubt their previous belief because the higher standards of justification in this context make their initial observation insufficient for knowledge.**, **If the knowledge status of the same belief can change depending on stakes, this might imply that in high-stakes cases, we could inadvertently or unknowingly fall into skepticism, as any belief might be scrutinized to a point of no longer being knowledge.**
