## Content

**Suppose we consider a case where a person holds a false belief but corrects it upon receiving new evidence, demonstrating intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we must acknowledge the personâ€™s virtuous behavior, yet the initial belief was false.**, **A necessary condition of knowledge seems to be absent in cases where an intellectually virtuous person holds a false belief, indicating intellectual virtue alone is insufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires beliefs to be correct in a stable manner over time, independent of new corrections, which intellectual virtue cannot guarantee on its own.**
