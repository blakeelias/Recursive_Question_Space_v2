## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition and is justified in believing it based on all available evidence. Unbeknownst to them, there is a defeater, a fact that undermines their justification, but they never encounter this defeater. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the proposition.**, **A plausible principle is that if a person believes a true proposition and it aligns with all available evidence, they have knowledge. This principle suggests that unknown defeaters should not overturn knowledge.**
