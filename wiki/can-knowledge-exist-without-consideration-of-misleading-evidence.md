## Content

**Suppose a person has strong evidence that it will rain due to dark clouds and storm warnings. Unknown to them, this belief is based on an error, as no rain follows. Consider this revised scenario without false lemmas but introducing misleading but non-false evidence. Intuitively, we refrain from attributing knowledge despite a lack of false beliefs.**, **Knowledge may depend not just on the absence of false assumptions but also on recognizing and dismissing misleading but non-false evidence. This complicates the idea that eliminating false lemmas suffices for knowledge.**
