**Consider a scenario where a dog navigates around its environment successfully by smell, obtaining true beliefs about its surroundings. Intuitively, we would judge the dog knows something about its environment even if it does not exercise intellectual virtues as humans understand them.**, **There is a plausible principle that non-human animals can have knowledge despite lacking human-like intellectual virtues, suggesting the necessity of intellectual virtue is too restrictive.**
