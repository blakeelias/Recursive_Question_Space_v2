**Suppose a person believes that there is a red car outside purely by chance and there is indeed a red car outside.**, **In this case, the person believes, the proposition is true, and yet the belief is not formed by any reliable process as it is based purely on luck.**, **This challenges the sufficiency condition for animal knowledge requiring only belief, truth, and reliability.**
