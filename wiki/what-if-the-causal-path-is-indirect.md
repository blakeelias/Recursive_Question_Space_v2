## Content

**Consider a case where a person's belief in a proposition is caused indirectly, such as learning about a past event through an elaborate system of documentation and hearsay. The belief is true and causally connected through intermediaries, yet the knowledge attribution feels weak.**, **An appropriate causal connection for knowledge should be direct; however, many truths are known through complex, indirect causal chains.**
