**Suppose we have a case where someone believes the weather will be sunny tomorrow because a meteorologist predicted it, but the meteorologist's prediction was actually wrong this time. It still turns out sunny because of an unforeseen weather change. Intuitively, we would have to say that the person doesn't know it will be sunny.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just a justified true belief if the process leading to truth is unreliable or accidental.**
