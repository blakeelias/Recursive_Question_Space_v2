**Epistemic luck occurs when a belief happens to be true by chance rather than through a reliable process. It challenges the notion that external conditions can fully account for knowledge.**, **For example, a person might fortuitously guess the correct answer to a difficult question without understanding or reliable information. The element of luck implies that they don't truly 'know' in a robust epistemic sense, despite satisfying external conditions.**, **Externalism's reliance on external reliability does not preclude the possibility of knowledge being attributed to beliefs that are true merely by chance.**
