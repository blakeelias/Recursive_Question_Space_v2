## Content

**Suppose a person forms a belief through a process that is reliable purely by accident, such as randomly trusting a usually unreliable source that happens to be right this time. Intuitively, we would say the person lacks knowledge.**, **A cognitive process being reliable involves consistent truth outputs across a range of scenarios, not merely occasional accuracy by chance.**, **Knowledge is undermined if the reliability of the cognitive process stems from mere coincidence rather than a systematic and dependable mechanism.**
