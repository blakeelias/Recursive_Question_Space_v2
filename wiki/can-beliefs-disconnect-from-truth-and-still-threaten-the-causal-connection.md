**Consider a case where a person believes that it is raining because they hear the sound of raindrops on their window. However, it is not actually raining; instead, there is a recording of raindrops being played. Intuitively, we would not say the person knows it is raining.**, **The causal theory would require a true proposition of rain, but the belief is based on a sound, which does not appropriately connect causally to the fact that it is raining.**
