## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a chess player skillfully predicts their opponent's move largely based on intuition developed through practice, yet without active engagement of intellectual virtue. Intuitively, we might say they know their opponent's move without intellectual virtue being involved.**, **It is implausible to contend that highly skilled activities always implicate intellectual virtues explicitly in conscious thought, challenging the necessary role of intellectual virtue.**
