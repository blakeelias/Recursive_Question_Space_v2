**Consider a Gettier case where a person has a justified true belief yet does not have knowledge.**, **Intuitively, despite context-dependent justification, such cases show that justified true belief alone does not suffice for knowledge.**, **This suggests that contextualism does not resolve the Gettier problem if justification standards alone are insufficient.**
