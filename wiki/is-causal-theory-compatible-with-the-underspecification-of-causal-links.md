## Content

**In complex causal chains, the specific causal link leading to a belief can often be underspecified or unclear.**, **The theory requires clear causal connections, yet in practice, many beliefs do not fit neatly into a single causal path.**, **Knowledge occurs in cases where the causal history is insufficiently specified or understood.**
