## Content

**An individual's belief may accidentally be correct despite being derived from or involving a false lemma, due to factors such as coincidence or luck.**, **Such cases challenge whether the absence of false lemmas is indeed a necessary condition for knowledge, as the outcome seems accurate and justified.**, **If coincidence can result in true belief from false lemmas, then the necessity of eliminating false lemmas is questionable.**
