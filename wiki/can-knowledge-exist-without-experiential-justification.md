## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual forms a coherent set of beliefs through theoretical reasoning without direct sensory experience. Intuitively, we might judge that this person lacks knowledge because experiential justification appears necessary.**, **There is a plausible principle that experiential evidence is crucial for knowledge. This principle suggests that coherence within reasoning might not compensate for the absence of empirical support.**
