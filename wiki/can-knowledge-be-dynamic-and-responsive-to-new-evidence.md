## Content

**Suppose a person knows a proposition based on current justification but is later confronted with new evidence that acts as a defeater.**, **Knowledge is often adaptive, where acquiring new information adjusts beliefs rather than nullifies all past knowledge.**, **Positing the requirement of no true defeaters overlooks the potential dynamic nature of knowledge, adjusting and re-evaluating in light of new contexts.**
