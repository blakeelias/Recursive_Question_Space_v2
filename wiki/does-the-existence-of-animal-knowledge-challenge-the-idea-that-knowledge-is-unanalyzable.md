## Content

**Animal knowledge suggests the possibility of forms of knowledge that do not rely on complex concepts of belief or justification, indicating knowledge may not be fundamental but analyzable.**, **Consider a case where a dog finds a hidden toy repeatedly. Intuitively, we say the dog knows where the toy is, but without the cognitive framework of belief or justification, suggesting alternative forms of knowledge that might not fit the 'Knowledge First' framework.**
