**It is conceivable that a belief is true and justified by robust reasons or evidence, yet does not meet the requirement of adroitness, raising questions about whether such a belief counts as knowledge.**, **A case where a belief is based on thorough justification and happens to be true as well might intuitively qualify as knowledge, but might lack adroitness, challenging its classification under this view.**, **Many would argue intuitively that strong justification and truth are sufficient for knowledge without the necessity for complex cognitive adroitness being demonstrated.**
