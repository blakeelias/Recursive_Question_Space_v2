## Content

**Suppose a person holds a belief that is true purely by chance or luck rather than any cognitive skill or adroitness. Intuitively, we would hesitate to call this knowledge, indicating that adroitness might not fully capture necessary conditions.**, **In cases where external factors heavily influence accuracy, adroitness might be irrelevant, questioning whether knowledge actually hinges on skilled belief formation.**, **Non-cognitive factors such as environmental context or happenstance can sometimes ensure truth, yet they do not increase a belief's adroitness, suggesting that knowledge might involve more than cognitive skill alone.**
