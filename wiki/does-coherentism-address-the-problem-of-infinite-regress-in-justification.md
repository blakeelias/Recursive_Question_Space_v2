**To avoid an infinite regress of justifications, some beliefs need to be non-inferentially justified, which coherentism does not inherently provide.**, **Consider a child who believes her parents are trustworthy because they always tell the truth, but her justification relies on an endless chain of beliefs about behavior that can't all be justified by coherence alone.**, **The plausible principle of foundationalism posits the need for basic beliefs that do not require justification from other beliefs to halt the regress.**
