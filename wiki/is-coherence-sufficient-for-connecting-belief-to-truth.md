## Content

**There is a plausible principle that beliefs forming a coherent set must reliably indicate truth for knowledge to occur. This principle together with the notion of coherence not requiring external world linkage entails that coherence alone is insufficient for knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person holds a coherent belief system entirely disconnected from empirical observation. In such a scenario, coherence does not guarantee the truth of the beliefs.**
