## Content

**Suppose new evidence arrives that contradicts a person's previously coherent beliefs, resulting in incoherence. Intuitively, we may then question the knowledge status of those prior beliefs.**, **In a case where one belief is undeniable but contradicts the rest of a coherent system, the disruption suggests previous coherence alone did not constitute knowledge.**
