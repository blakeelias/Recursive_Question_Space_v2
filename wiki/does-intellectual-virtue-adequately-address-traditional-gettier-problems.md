**Consider a classic Gettier case where a person holds a justified true belief that results from correct reasoning but relies on faulty premises, like believing "Jill owns a Ford" after seeing her drive a rented Ford without realizing it's a rental. Intuitively, it seems irrational to attribute knowledge here despite the intellectual virtues involved.**, **There is a plausible principle that exercising intellectual virtue with justified belief does not suffice for knowledge if the connection to truth is coincidental.**
