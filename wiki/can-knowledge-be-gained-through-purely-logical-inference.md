## Content

**Suppose a person P knows mathematical axioms and derives a complex theorem through purely logical reasoning. Intuitively, it seems P knows the theorem.**, **There is no direct causal interaction between the abstract axioms and the person's belief in the theorem; the connection is instead mediated by abstract logical rules.**
