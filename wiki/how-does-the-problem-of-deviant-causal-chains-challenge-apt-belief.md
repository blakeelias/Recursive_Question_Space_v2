## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which someone forms a belief through a skillful process, but an unusual chain of events intervenes to make the belief true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the belief is apt despite the deviation, or that the intervention breaks the connection needed for knowledge. If we say it is apt, then we allow for knowledge by chance. If we say the intervention breaks the connection, then it suggests aptness is insufficient for knowledge.**
