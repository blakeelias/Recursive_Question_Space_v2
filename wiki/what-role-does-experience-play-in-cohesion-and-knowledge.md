**A person may have a well-cohering belief system that is entirely theoretical and lacks experiential justification. In such a case, intuitively, lack of involvement with empirical reality precludes knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where religious or philosophical beliefs cohere internally without empirical foundation. Without experience, the coherence does not guarantee knowledge.**
