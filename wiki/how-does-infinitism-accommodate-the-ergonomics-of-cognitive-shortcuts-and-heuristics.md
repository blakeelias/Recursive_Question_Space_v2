## Content

**Cognitive science shows humans frequently use shortcuts and heuristics, which effectively guide knowledge acquisition with finite justification. Infinitism's infinite requirement contradicts this efficient heuristic approach.**, **Suppose someone uses a well-developed heuristic to successfully navigate everyday tasks. Intuitively, they are seen as possessing knowledge without infinite justifications that oppose the pragmatic employing of heuristics.**
