## Content

**Consider a case in which a belief is both accurate (true) and formed through adroit reasoning but relies on an unusual external chance event; intuitively, it might not feel apt.**, **A belief may be shaped and held with considerable cognitive skill and be true, yet if external influences affect the accuracy, this might undermine its aptness.**, **External contingencies, even when a belief is accurate and adroit, can disrupt the conventional meeting of circumstances needed for aptness, making the concept of apt belief problematic.**
