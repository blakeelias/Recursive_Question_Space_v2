## Content

**Suppose a person is aware of several factors that might undermine their justification but are unaware of one hidden critical defeater. If the unseen defeater impacts their belief, intuitively, it challenges the sufficiency of the conditions for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that defeaters may not always be discernible by the subject holding the justification, creating instances where unseen defeaters can nonetheless undermine claimed knowledge even if not recognized.**
