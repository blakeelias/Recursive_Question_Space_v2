**Consider a scenario where a person claims knowledge based on a low standard of justification acceptable in their context.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, the claim might be accepted as knowledge within that context but dismissed in a context with higher standards.**, **It is implausible that different contexts could lead to different conclusions about what qualifies as knowledge without a change in the actual epistemic circumstances.**
