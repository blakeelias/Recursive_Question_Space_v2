## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, Alice, sees what appears to be a real, live sheep in a field. Based on this, Alice believes there is a sheep in the field. Unknown to Alice, the "sheep" she sees is actually a cleverly disguised dog. However, by pure coincidence, there is a real sheep hidden behind a hill in the field, making Alice's belief true. Although Alice's belief that there is a sheep in the field is justified and true, intuitively Alice does not actually know there is a sheep in the field.**
