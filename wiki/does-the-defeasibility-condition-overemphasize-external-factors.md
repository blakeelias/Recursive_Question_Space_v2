**Imagine a person has a belief that is justified and true, but they are unaware of certain facts that defeat their evidence, such as misinformation they never encounter. Intuitively, we might judge that the person has knowledge.**, **The idea that knowledge requires no true defeaters suggests that external factors unknown to the believer can remove knowledge status.**, **If knowledge depends overly on facts external to the believer that they cannot access, this seems to counter our intuitions about what constitutes knowledge.**
