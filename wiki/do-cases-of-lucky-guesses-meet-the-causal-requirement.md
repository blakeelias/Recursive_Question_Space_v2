## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person P, who is flipping a coin, guesses that it will land heads and it does. Intuitively, we would not say P knows it would land heads, even if it does.**, **In this scenario, P's belief correctly predicted the outcome, but there is no causal connection between Pâ€™s belief and the outcome, suggesting the causal connection is necessary for knowledge.**
