## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person retrieves a true belief from memory that they cannot corroborate with any external source. Intuitively, we either have to say that this belief is knowledge or it is not, yet without external validation, attributing knowledge purely on memory seems suspect.**, **There is a plausible principle that unaided memory itself cannot always secure knowledge unless the remembered content can be connected to new reliable cognitive processes, raising doubts about the sufficiency of reliability alone.**
