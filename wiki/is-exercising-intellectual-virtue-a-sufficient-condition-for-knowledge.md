## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person exercises all intellectual virtues but unknowingly cherry-picks data, leading to accurate belief by chance. Intuitively, the belief's accidental accuracy suggests intellectual virtue isn't sufficient for knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that complete knowledge requires both virtues and comprehensive data understanding. This likely suggests that virtues alone don't suffice for knowledge attainment.**
