**Consider a case where a person believes a proposition due to what seems like aptitude, but their true belief's correctness is due to unforeseen factors like a lucky accident. Intuitively, Gettier-style cases show that just having true beliefs from skills isn't sufficient for knowledge, if there's intervening luck that disconnects the outcome from the ability**, **It is implausible that apt beliefs alone can address Gettier problems, as they do not account for hidden elements of luck disrupting the skill-accuracy link**
