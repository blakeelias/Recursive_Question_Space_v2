## Content

**Consider a case where a person provides justification for a belief, but each reason also requires further reasons ad infinitum. Intuitively, such a person cannot be said to have real knowledge, as they never reach a foundational justification.**, **Knowledge should be accessible within the epistemic limits of human reason, yet an infinite regress suggests knowledge is beyond these limits.**, **Without a foundation or terminating point, every belief is unjustified, making genuine knowledge inaccessible.**
