**Consider a scenario in which someone forms a belief based purely on an unreliable source, like a horoscope. Even if the horoscope accidentally corresponds to a true proposition, we would intuitively not say that they have knowledge. Externalism claims that reliability suffices for knowledge, but fails to account for such unreliable sources producing accurate beliefs.**, **Even if a belief formed by unreliable means happens to be true, externalist criteria for knowledge would unfairly count it as knowledge. This contradicts our intuitions regarding the necessity of reliable origins.**
