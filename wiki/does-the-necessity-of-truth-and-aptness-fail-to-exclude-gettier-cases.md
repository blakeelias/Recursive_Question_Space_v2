**Consider a case where a person believes a true proposition based on justified reasoning, yet it turns out true by coincidence, called a Gettier case. Intuitively, such cases are understood as examples where a person doesn’t truly know, despite the belief being true.**, **The presence of such accidental truths shows that a belief can be accidentally true and adroitly formed without it satisfying our intuition of knowledge—a challenge for defining such beliefs as apt.**
