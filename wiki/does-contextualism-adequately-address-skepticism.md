**Contextual standards for justification are supposed to vary depending on the context in which knowledge is claimed, potentially lowering skepticism in low-context scenarios.**, **In high-context scenarios where skepticism is strongest, demanding higher justification standards may not assuage skeptical doubts, as skepticism can question any justification.**, **Skepticism about the adequacy of justification standards remains a problem for contextualism, as it might fail to justify knowledge even in stable contexts.**
