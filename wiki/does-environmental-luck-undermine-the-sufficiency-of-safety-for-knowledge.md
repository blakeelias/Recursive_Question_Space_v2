## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone forms a belief based on correct observational evidence, but unknown to them, they are in an environment where their belief could easily have been false due to misleading similar environments. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person lacks knowledge.**, **It is implausible that merely because the belief could not easily have been false in the actual world, the person has knowledge, given such environmental luck could have influenced the belief elsewhere.**
