**Consider a scenario where two people with differing epistemic standards are debating whether they each know a proposition based on differing levels of justification. In a context where one person requires stronger justification, they may deny that they know the same proposition as sufficiently justified in a looser context.**, **In situations like peer disagreement, one might expect both parties to converge on a single standard of justification to resolve the contrariness of their claimsâ€”something contextualism allows to float rather than provide clarity.**, **It is implausible to resolve genuine epistemic disagreements if speakers refer to different contextual standards for justification without any grounding commonality.**
