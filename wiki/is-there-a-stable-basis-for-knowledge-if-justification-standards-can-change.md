## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for knowledge to be meaningful, it should have a stable basis across different contexts.**, **If the standards for justification can shift with context, then what counts as knowledge in one scenario might not elsewhere, leading to instability.**, **This instability seems to undermine the notion that knowledge is a reliable and consistent concept.**
