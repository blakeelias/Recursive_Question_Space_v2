**Suppose we have a community's collective belief in a scientific theory based on the aggregated work of experts, leading to a true and accurate assessment of the theory. Intuitively, each individual within the collective may not know details of the theory themselves.**, **There is a plausible question about whether communal understanding fully encapsulates individual knowledge, challenging whether skill or aptitude can be distributed across many rather than possessed by one.**
