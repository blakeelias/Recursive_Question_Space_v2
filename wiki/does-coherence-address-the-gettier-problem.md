## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief based on evidence that typically would lead to a false conclusion, akin to a Gettier case, yet the belief coheres with their system of beliefs. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge in this case.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just true beliefs that fit within a coherent belief system; it requires an absence of luck in the truth of the belief.**
