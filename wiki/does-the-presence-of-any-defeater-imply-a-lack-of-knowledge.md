## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition based on reliable evidence, yet an unjustified claim misleadingly appears as a relevant defeater.**, **Intuitively, the presence of misleading information shouldn't negate one's knowledge if the original justification remains stronger.**, **There is a plausible principle that an unjustified claim posing as a defeater should not impact the epistemic status of a well-justified belief.**
