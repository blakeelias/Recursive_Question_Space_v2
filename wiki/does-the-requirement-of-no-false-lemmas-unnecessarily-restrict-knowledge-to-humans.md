**Humans often operate with assumptions that are not immediately verifiable, making it difficult to separate which assumptions might later be identified as false.**, **Other agents or beings might lack the capacity to verify every assumption on their own, yet can still arrive at knowledge through reliable means.**, **If knowledge requires being free of false lemmas, then reliance on unverifiable assumptions might disqualify many instances of what seems like knowledge.**
