**Ordinary language use of "know" seems to imply a stable concept that does not vary with minor context changes.**, **People intuitively consider knowledge as a somewhat stable state that is not easily undermined by mere conversational shifts.**, **If the standards for justification change with context, this can lead to ordinary situations where one might be ascribed knowledge and then, without any significant change in reality, be denied it shortly after, contradicting common linguistic intuitions about knowledge.**
