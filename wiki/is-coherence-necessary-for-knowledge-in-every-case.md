**Suppose we have a case in which a person accurately navigates to a destination using a map they unreflectively trust. Intuitively, we might say they know how to get there despite lacking a coherent supporting belief system explaining the mapâ€™s reliability.**, **There is a plausible principle that immediate perceptual knowledge or intuitive insights can bypass the necessity for coherence in more complex belief systems.**, **Consider a scenario in which a chess player suddenly remembers a winning move during a game; we might judge the player knows the move even if it doesn't connect coherently with all other moves in their mind.**
