## Content

**Consider a scenario where two people have the same belief, it is true, and practically successful, but one person has reasoned evidence and the other does not.**, **While both beliefs might lead to practical success, the lack of evidence-backed reasoning in one highlights that practical success alone does not substitute for justification in constituting knowledge.**
