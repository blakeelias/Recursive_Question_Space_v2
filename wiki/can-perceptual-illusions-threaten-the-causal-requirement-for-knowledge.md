**Suppose someone perceives a mirage of water in a desert and forms the false belief that there is water, yet coincidentally water is present but unseen nearby. Intuitively, it is not clear the person knows there is water.**, **In a scenario involving perceptual errors, a belief might coincide with the truth independently of a reliable causal process, challenging the necessity of a causal connection for knowledge.**
