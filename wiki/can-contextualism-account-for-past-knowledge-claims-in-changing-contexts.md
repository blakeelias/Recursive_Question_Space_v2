## Content

**Suppose a context's standards for justification change over time, either becoming stricter or more lenient.**, **Intuitively, this change might lead us to revise previous knowledge claims about events that occurred in the past under different standards.**, **It is implausible that past knowledge claims should be continuously subject to reinterpretation based on present contexts, as this leads to historical inconsistency.**
