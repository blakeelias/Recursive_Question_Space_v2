**In a scenario adapted from Gettier cases, a person named Smith believes 'Jones owns a Ford' because of reliable evidence, but this belief is true due to an unrelated event around Jones actually owning a Ford.**, **There is an appropriate causal connection between the belief and the corresponding proposition being true in the typical sense.**, **Intuitively, we would not say Smith genuinely knows 'Jones owns a Ford' due to the coincidence involved.**
