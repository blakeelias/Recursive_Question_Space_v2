## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a true belief through sheer luck rather than an appropriate causal connection, such as guessing the outcome of a random event correctly. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge in this case.**, **A scenario where a person holds a true belief resulting from a lucky guess lacks an appropriate causal link between the belief and the truth of the proposition.**, **The absence of such a causal link implies that merely having a lucky true belief without the causal connection is not sufficient for knowledge.**
