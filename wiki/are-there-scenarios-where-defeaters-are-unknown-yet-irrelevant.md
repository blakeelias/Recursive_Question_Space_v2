## Content

**Suppose a person's true belief is justified without known true defeaters, but they are unaware of some true but contextually irrelevant information that could be seen as a defeater. Intuitively, we might still attribute knowledge to the person.**, **Having a condition that excludes unknown but contextually irrelevant true defeaters might lead to rejecting genuine knowledge claims without basis.**, **If the irrelevance of certain factors renders them non-defeating in practice, insisting on their exclusion might mischaracterize cases of knowledge.**
