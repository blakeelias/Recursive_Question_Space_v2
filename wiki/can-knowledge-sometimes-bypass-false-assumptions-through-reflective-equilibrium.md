**Reflective equilibrium involves balancing and adjusting beliefs to achieve consistency across a wide range of relevant scenarios, potentially correcting false assumptions. This might intuitively support knowledge without rejecting all ideals derived from false lemmas.**, **Consider moral reasoning where initial judgments are revised in light of new understandings, producing reliable knowledge despite any initial false moral assumptions.**
