**A belief's practical success can depend on factors beyond its truth, such as environmental or social conditions that favor certain actions**, **It is plausible that external conditions, rather than intrinsic truth, contribute to a belief's success in practice**, **This recognition that extraneous factors influence practical success suggests that truth might be a more central determinant for knowledge than practical outcomes alone**
