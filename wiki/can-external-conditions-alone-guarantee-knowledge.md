## Content

**There is a plausible principle that internal states, such as justification or understanding, are necessary for knowledge. This principle along with the view that external conditions alone can guarantee knowledge entails that someone could know something even if they have no internal sense or recognition of why it's true.**, **Consider a scenario where a person randomly guesses a true proposition based on a totally unreliable source, like a lucky coin toss. Even if the external reliability condition is somehow met accidentally, it is implausible to say that the person knows the proposition.**
