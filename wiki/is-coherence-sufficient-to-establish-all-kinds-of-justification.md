**It is implausible that coherence alone sufficiently justifies a belief without any empirical or perceptual input.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a detective constructs a coherent narrative about a crime based on partial evidence but lacks a crucial piece of information. Intuitively, we might say the narrative is not justified knowledge due to this missing element.**, **There is a plausible principle that requiring only coherence for justification would permit guessing, provided the parts fit together suitably, regardless of external validation.**
