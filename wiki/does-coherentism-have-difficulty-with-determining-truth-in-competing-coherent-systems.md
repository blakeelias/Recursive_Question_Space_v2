## Content

**Consider a case of two equally coherent belief systems where both explain phenomena differently, such as two rival scientific theories. Intuitively, we would not conclude both systems equally offer knowledge of true propositions, yet coherentism struggles to differentiate between them.**, **There is a plausible principle that true knowledge should be distinguishable between competing coherent explanations, as merely being internally consistent is insufficient for truth articulation.**
