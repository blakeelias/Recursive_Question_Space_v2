## Content

**It is implausible that mere coherence within a set of internal beliefs suffices for knowledge without some external connection to truth or reality.**, **Consider a scenario in which a personâ€™s coherent belief system is entirely based on a simulation or virtual reality, disconnected from the actual world. Intuitively, such a person does not have knowledge of propositions despite the coherence.**
