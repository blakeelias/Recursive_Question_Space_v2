## Content

**Claiming knowledge as a fundamental epistemic concept makes it resistant to analysis and might lead to circular explanations of other epistemic concepts.**, **If knowledge is posited as fundamental, explaining concepts like belief or justification solely through knowledge risks circular reasoning, as these concepts are traditionally interrelated in epistemic evaluation. Intuitively, relying on knowledge alone might neglect the foundational role that belief and justification play in conceptual understanding.**
