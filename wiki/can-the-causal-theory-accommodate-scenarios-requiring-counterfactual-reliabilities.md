## Content

**Consider a case where a scientist, through several experimental failures, eventually discovers a principle that consistently holds. Intuitively, the knowledge results from reliable testing over errors.**, **It is implausible that incidental causation—the singular occasion of a connection—is sufficient without reliance on counterfactual dependencies, which reflect how beliefs would hold under varying circumstances.**
