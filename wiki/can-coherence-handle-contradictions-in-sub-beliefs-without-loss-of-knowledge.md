## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a scientist has coherent theories in their field yet inadvertently holds contradictory beliefs about underpinning assumptions. Intuitively, we might say they lack knowledge due specifically to these contradictions.**, **There is a plausible principle that maintaining consistency even among sub-beliefs is essential for upholding coherence without invoking knowledge doubts.**, **It is implausible that coherence claims can overlook contradictions in foundational beliefs while still asserting genuine knowledge.**
