**Consider a scenario where cultural, historical, or scientific contexts dramatically shift, altering what is considered justified. For instance, lightning might have been believed to be divine wrath before modern science provided electrical explanations. Intuitively, judgments about knowledge appear to shift with context.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge is critically context-dependent, as what counts as justified belief may vary across different contexts rather than depending on fixed or universal criteria.**
