## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person gains knowledge by using a highly reliable but intellectually unvirtuous process, such as blindly trusting an infallible computer. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person knows the proposition despite the lack of intellectual virtue.**, **It is implausible that intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge when reliable external processes can yield true beliefs without it.**, **The necessity of intellectual virtue in all cases of knowledge is undermined by situations where reliable external sources provide true beliefs independently of the individual's intellectual efforts.**
