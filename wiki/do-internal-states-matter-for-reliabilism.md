## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has true beliefs, produced by reliable external processes, but the individual misunderstands how these processes work. Intuitively, this lack of internal insight suggests the person lacks full knowledge.**, **It is implausible that one can be said to have knowledge if they are unaware of or misunderstand the processes generating their beliefs, even if these processes are reliable. This challenges a purely externalist concept like reliabilism.**
