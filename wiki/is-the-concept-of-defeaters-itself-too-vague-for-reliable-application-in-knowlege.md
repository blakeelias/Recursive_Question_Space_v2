## Content

**Consider the proposition that the very notion of defeaters is vague, leading to ambiguity in determining the presence or absence of truthful knowledge. This vagueness creates uncertainty in applying defeasibility as a strict criterion in all cases.**, **There is a plausible principle that suggests any conceptually vague criteria may fail in providing conclusive conditions for knowledge, challenging the effectiveness of defeasibility criteria.**
