**In a typical eyewitness testimony scenario, an individual claims to have seen a bank robbery and accurately recounts the events. Their belief matches the truth and they are confident they saw the event. However, the underlying causal process connecting the event to the belief could be questioned if visual perception is not precisely direct.**, **Eyewitness testimony hinges on the idea that observation provides a reliable causal link, but perceptual errors or distortive factors might suggest there are weaknesses in assuming a straightforward causal connection.**
