## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people are discussing whether they "know" it's raining outside. In one context, such as casually at home, they require little evidence, like just looking out the window. In another context, like a weather report, they require more evidence, like radar images. Intuitively, if one person knows in one context, but not in another with the same amount of evidence, this seems incoherent.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person claims to "know" something in a low-stakes context but admits to not knowing in a high-stakes context with no change in evidence. Intuitively, knowledge should depend on evidence, not stakes, yet context seems to alter what qualifies as knowledge.**
