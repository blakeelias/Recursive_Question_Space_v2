## Content

**There is a plausible principle that not all true beliefs can be traced back to a causally sufficient explanation that qualifies as knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person guesses the correct answer without any reliable basis. Intuitively, we would not attribute knowledge despite the truth of belief.**, **The causal theory might struggle in cases where the belief is true but lacks a structured causal story.**
