**Consider a person witnessing an AI-generated deepfake video showing a widely recognized personality making false statements, forming belief based on visual and audio characteristics.**, **Imagine that if the reality didn't match as video projected, the believability aspect might lead observers to continue holding belief through the same technological deceit.**, **The sensitivity requirement, asking non-persistence with falsehood, might ignore practical challenges where tech dynamics complicate belief formation.**
