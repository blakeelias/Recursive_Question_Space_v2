## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person's belief is grounded in a false lemma, but the false lemma is irrelevant to the truth of the believed proposition. Intuitively, it seems that not all false lemmas undermine knowledge equally.**, **In cases where false assumptions play no direct role in the justification of a belief, it feels less compelling to deny that the belief constitutes knowledge.**
