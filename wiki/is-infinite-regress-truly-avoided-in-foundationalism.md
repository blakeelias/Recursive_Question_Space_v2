**A belief is considered foundational if it does not rely on any other beliefs for its justification.**, **In order to avoid an infinite regress of justification, foundational beliefs must be self-justifying or justified in a non-inferential manner.**, **It is implausible that there exist beliefs that can be justified without reference to any other beliefs, which foundational beliefs require in order to stop the regress.**
