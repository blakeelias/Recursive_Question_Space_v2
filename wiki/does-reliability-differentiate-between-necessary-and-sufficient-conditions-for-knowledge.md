**Consider a reliable cognitive process that always produces true beliefs, yet some beliefs formed are by luck rather than cognitive processing, such as stumbling upon a true fact accidentally. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that luck does not contribute to knowledge.**, **A belief formed by chance, though following a reliable cognitive method in others, would still fall short of constituting knowledge.**
