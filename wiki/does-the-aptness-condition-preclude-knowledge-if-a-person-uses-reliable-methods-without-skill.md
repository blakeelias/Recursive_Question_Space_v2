## Content

**Suppose a person uses a reliable method they do not understand, resulting in a true belief. Their belief is accurate. Intuitively, this reliable method should contribute to knowledge.**, **Without skill, even though the belief is accurate, it lacks adroitness and thereby fails the criteria for aptness as discussed, suggesting one might know without showing personal skill.**
