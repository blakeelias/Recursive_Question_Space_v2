## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person reads about a past event that is accurately reported, but the causal chain of information involves several intermediaries, such that the connection between the event and their belief is indirect. Intuitively, we would judge that the person still knows the fact about the event.**, **An indirect causal connection through multiple intermediaries challenges the necessity of a direct causal link for knowledge.**, **If an appropriately reliable chain of transmission is intact, knowledge should be ascribed even without a direct causal connection.**
