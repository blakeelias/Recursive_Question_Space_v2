## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a computer program outputs a true belief through an algorithm that users believe to be reliable. Intuitively, we either have to say that this human understanding of reliability translates to real knowledge or it does not, raising difficulties.**, **There is a plausible principle that the symbolic function of algorithms may not straightforwardly transfer to human cognitive processes, thus complicating the assessment of algorithm-generated beliefs as knowledge.**
