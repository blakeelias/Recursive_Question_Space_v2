## Content

**There is a plausible principle that a belief must lead to practical success consistently for it to be considered linked to knowledge**, **Consider a situation where a person holds a belief, acts on it successfully once, but fails in all other attempts. Intuitively, the irregular success does not constitute knowledge**, **It is implausible that a single instance of practical utility suffices to establish knowledge**
