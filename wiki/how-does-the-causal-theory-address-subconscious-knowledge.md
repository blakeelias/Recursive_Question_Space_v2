**Consider a scenario where a person knows how to play a piece of music on the piano without consciously realizing how they acquired this knowledge â€” for instance, learning through repeated listening rather than explicit instruction, resulting in true beliefs about the music they can play accurately. However, they lack an awareness of a causal connection to the formation of their belief.**, **Subconscious acquisition of knowledge introduces complexity into claims of a causal link since the processes leading to the belief are hidden from conscious awareness.**
