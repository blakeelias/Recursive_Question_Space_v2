**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes that it is raining because they can directly observe the rain through their window, but this belief does not fit within their otherwise coherent system of beliefs. Intuitively, they still seem to know that it is raining despite the incoherence.**, **It is implausible that a coherent set of beliefs is necessary for knowledge in cases where empirical evidence provides strong justification.**
