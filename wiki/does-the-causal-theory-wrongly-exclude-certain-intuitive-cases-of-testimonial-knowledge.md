## Content

**A journalist reports a breaking news story exactly as it happens, relying on a trustworthy source. Intuitively, the public gains knowledge through the accurate testimony, dependent on trust rather than a direct causal connection with the event.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge can be transmitted across trustworthy testimony even if the recipient lacks direct causal exposure to the fact itself.**
