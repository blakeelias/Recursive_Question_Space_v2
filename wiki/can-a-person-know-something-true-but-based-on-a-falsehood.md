## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person has a justified true belief in a proposition because of a false assumption that logically supports the belief. In such a case, intuitively we might yet feel the person has knowledge.**, **For example, suppose a person believes there is a dog in the yard because they see what appears to be a dog, which is actually a cardboard cutout, yet there is indeed a real dog in the yard unseen by them. Their belief is true, justified by their perception, but based on a false assumption.**
