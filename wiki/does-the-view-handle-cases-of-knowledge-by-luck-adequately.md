**Consider a scenario in which a person enters a lottery and blindly guesses the winning number. Intuitively, even if their guess is correct and justified under some assumptions, we would not say they knew the number.**, **A person who guesses correctly based solely on luck should not be considered knowing, although no false assumptions underwrite their belief, highlighting a limitation of the 'No False Lemmas' condition.**
