**Imagine a scenario where a person believes a statement because it was accidentally told to them by an unreliable fortune teller, and coincidentally the statement is true. Intuitively, we would not consider this knowledge since the justification came from an unreliable source.**, **This suggests that the source of justification is crucial, and a mere justified true belief doesn't guarantee knowledge without trustworthy origins.**
