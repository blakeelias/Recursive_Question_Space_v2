## Content

**Consider a case where what is practically successful for one person might not be for another due to differing subjective goals or values. Intuitively, it might seem that practical success as a measure for knowledge is unreliable due to its subjective variability.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should rest on objective criteria, suggesting practical success is insufficient as a universal standard.**
