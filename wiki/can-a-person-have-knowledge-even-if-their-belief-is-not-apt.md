**A person might have a true belief based on a lucky guess without the belief being a result of any skill or ability.**, **A belief that is true by mere luck is not apt since it lacks the requisite skill.**, **If the belief is true by luck, then it conflicts with the requirement that knowledge involves an apt belief.**
