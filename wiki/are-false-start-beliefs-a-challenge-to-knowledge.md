## Content

**Suppose a person initially believes a false proposition, yet through intellectual effort, arrives at a true conclusion. Following this, their new belief seems to depend on a prior falsehood. Intuitively, we might question whether their ultimate belief counts as knowledge.**, **If knowledge requires a pure genesis from intellectual virtue, then any incorporation of erroneous beliefs along the process could compromise the status of subsequent beliefs as knowledge.**
