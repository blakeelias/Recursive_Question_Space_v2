## Content

**If the standards for justification can vary depending on the context, then contexts with extremely high standards can always be imagined.**, **In such contexts, it seems plausible that almost no beliefs can meet those standards, suggesting that we know very little or nothing at all.**, **The possibility of such contexts brings into question whether we truly know anything in more relaxed contexts, since someone could always cast doubt by invoking stricter standards.**
