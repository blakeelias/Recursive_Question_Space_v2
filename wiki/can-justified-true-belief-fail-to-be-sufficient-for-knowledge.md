**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition, has justification for the belief, and the proposition is true due to some unforeseen coincidence. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**, **An example of this is a case where a person sees a clock that shows the correct time, believes it is correct, and it happens to be true, despite the clock being broken. This situation makes us intuitively inclined to say the person does not know the time.**
