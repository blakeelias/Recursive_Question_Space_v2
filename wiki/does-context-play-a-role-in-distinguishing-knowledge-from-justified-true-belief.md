## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a linguist predicts a word usage trend based on justified assumptions about language evolution, and the trend actually occurs. Intuitively, it seems the prediction aligns with context, yet does not reflect definitive knowledge because contextual understanding was speculative.**, **A plausible principle suggests knowledge requires alignment not just with justification and truth, but with non-speculative, reliable context-specific connections, distinguishing the mere justified true belief.**
