## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes a proposition due to a justified inference from a false premise. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not have knowledge of the true proposition even though their belief could not easily have been false.**, **There is a plausible principle that if having a true belief that could not easily have been false was sufficient for knowledge, then the person should be considered to have knowledge in such scenarios. This principle together with the intuition in the scenario entails that having a belief that could not easily have been false is not always sufficient for knowledge.**
