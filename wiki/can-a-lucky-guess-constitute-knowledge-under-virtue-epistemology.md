## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person makes a lucky guess about the outcome of a future event, such as the flip of a fair coin landing heads, and their guess turns out to be correct. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge despite their belief being true.**, **A lucky guess does not arise from an exercise of intellectual virtue, as it lacks any skill, competence, or intellectual ability typically required for knowledge.**
