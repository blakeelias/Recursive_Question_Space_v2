**An infinite series of reasons for a belief might eventually repeat, leading to a circular justification.**, **Circular justification undermines the very notion of progress or depth in reasoning, as it fails to provide genuine support for the belief.**, **If reason sequences are allowed to repeat, then the justification for a belief is not genuinely infinite and non-repeating as required.**
