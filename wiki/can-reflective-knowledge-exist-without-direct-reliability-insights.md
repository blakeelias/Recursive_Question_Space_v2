## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person accurately predicts outcomes consistently without any higher-order insight into their methods. Intuitively, we might regard this person as possessing reflective knowledge due to their outcome success.**, **This suggests the insight into the reliability condition may be overly strict if consistent accuracy could bypass it.**, **A plausible principle calls into question whether direct inferential insight is necessary for deemed reflective knowledge.**
