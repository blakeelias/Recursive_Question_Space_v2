**Imagine a case in which a person believes a proposition based on a source that is generally unreliable, and the belief turns out to be true. Intuitively, even with true belief, the reliance on an unreliable source prevents this from being knowledge.**, **It is implausible that true belief derived from unreliable sources, even if justified under certain circumstances, constitutes knowledge. The truth of the belief ought to derive from reliable justifications to be considered knowledge.**
