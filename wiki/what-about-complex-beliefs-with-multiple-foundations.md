## Content

**Suppose a person knows a historical fact through a combination of direct observation and background historical knowledge. The belief derives from multiple foundational sources, complicating the notion of what is 'foundational.' This could challenge the clarity of 'foundational beliefs.'**, **In complex cases where knowledge results from several overlapping sources, labeling any belief foundational or derived from foundational beliefs may seem problematic.**
