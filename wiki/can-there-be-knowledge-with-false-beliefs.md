## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person strongly believes a proposition based on false evidence, and this false evidence leads to a fortuitously true belief. In such a scenario, intuitively we might judge that the person does not genuinely know the proposition.**, **It is plausible to hold that knowledge requires belief in a true proposition based on true beliefs leading to justification. This requirement seems necessary to separate genuine knowledge from lucky guesses or accidents.**
