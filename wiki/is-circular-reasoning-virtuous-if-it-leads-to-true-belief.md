## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person uses circular reasoning to arrive at a true belief. Intuitively, we would judge that circular reasoning does not exercise intellectual virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires avoiding fallacious reasoning. This principle together with the use of circular reasoning implies that the belief does not arise from intellectual virtue.**
