**Consider a person who forms the true belief that a famous artist is in town because they randomly decide to visit an art gallery. Unknown to them, the artist is at the same gallery due to a sudden change in schedule. Intuitively, they do not seem to have knowledge of the artist's presence.**, **While the causal connection can be argued as existing, it is largely fortuitous and lacks the grounding necessary for genuine knowledge.**
