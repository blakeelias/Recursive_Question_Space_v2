## Content

**Suppose we have a belief that is justified and true in a particular context, like knowing a plane is on time in non-urgent context, but fails when scrutinized further, like under extreme weather impacting flight schedules. Intuitively, this contextual shift suggests the belief might not be knowledge in all contexts.**, **It is implausible to fix knowledge to justified true belief without context-sensitivity, as knowledge might require adaptability to different contexts which the strict JTB account overlooks.**
