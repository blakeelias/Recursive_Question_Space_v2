**Consider a scenario where a person is deeply convinced of a false proposition due to an overwhelming body of misleading but seemingly reliable evidence, and their behavior reflects an understanding and use of this proposition as if it were true. Intuitively, we might feel that this person "knows" the world as presented to them, despite the proposition's falsity.**, **It is implausible that a person relying on well-justified, albeit false, information never possesses knowledge in any meaningful sense.**
