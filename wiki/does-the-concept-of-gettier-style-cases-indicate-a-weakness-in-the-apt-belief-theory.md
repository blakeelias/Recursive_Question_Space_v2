**There is a plausible principle that if a person has a justified belief in a true proposition due to accurate perception and reasoning, it generally constitutes knowledge.**, **Consider scenarios in which a justified, true belief is obtained through inference, but unknown factors make the specific instance misleading, such as a broken clock that shows the correct time. Intuitively, such beliefs lack knowledge despite meeting the criteria of the theory.**
