**Suppose a person forms a belief through a process that is accidentally, albeit reliably, aligned with truth due to a rare coincidence.**, **The reliability of the process in this case does not stem from any systematic truth-tracking capacity but rather from an unintended alignment with truth due to external factors.**, **This raises doubts about whether accidental reliability can suffice for knowledge, as it lacks an inherent connection to truth.**
