## Content

**Consider scenarios in which a person forms a belief due to epistemic luck, where the belief is true and justified, yet derived under circumstances that intuitively lack knowledge. Such cases show that justified true belief might not be sufficient for knowledge.**, **A person believes a rare event will occur based on an unreliable source; the event does occur, making the belief true and justified, yet intuition suggests the person does not have knowledge.**
