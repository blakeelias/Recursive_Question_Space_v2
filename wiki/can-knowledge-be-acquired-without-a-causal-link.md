## Content

**A scenario in which a person has a true belief formed through sheer coincidence, such as guessing the outcome of a coin toss, is not a case where the person has knowledge.**, **In such a scenario, there might be no causal connection between the coin landing heads and the person's belief that it would land heads.**, **Intuitively, we would not say that someone knows the coin will land heads merely because they happened to guess correctly without a causal basis.**
