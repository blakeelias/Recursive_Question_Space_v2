## Content

**In some cases, individuals appear to have knowledge yet cannot explicitly trace or explain the causal path linking their belief to the truth.**, **For instance, intuitive judgments often involve tacit knowledge where no explicit causal path can be articulated.**, **This raises questions about whether causal links must be traceable or explicable to constitute knowledge.**
