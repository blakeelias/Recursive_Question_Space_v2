## Content

**Consider a case where a person arrives at a true belief accidentally through a series of unlikely causal events.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively we would not say the person has knowledge, despite there being a causal connection.**, **The presence of a causal connection does not adequately differentiate cases of genuine knowledge from lucky guesses.**
