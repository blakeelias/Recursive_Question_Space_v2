## Content

**Consider a case in which a person has interrelated beliefs that support each other, creating a network of justification. Intuitively, the presence of a true defeater for one belief in this network might not impact their overall knowledge.**, **The requirement for justification without any true defeaters does not address the interconnected nature of beliefs, where some might be susceptible to defeat without threatening the whole network's solidity.**, **If a single defeater in a complex network is unable to undermine broadly established knowledge, the strict no true defeaters condition may oversimplify knowledge dynamics.**
