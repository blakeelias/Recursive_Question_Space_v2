## Content

**Consider a situation where someone holds a justified true belief, but if they had access to additional information, their belief would no longer be justified. For example, someone believes their friend is in the house based on seeing their car in the driveway, yet the friend has lent the car to someone else. Intuitively, the presence of potential defeaters suggests that the belief lacks knowledge-quality security.**, **Any adequate account of knowledge must incorporate considerations where belief could be unseated by further evidence, demonstrating a gap in the justified true belief account's sufficiency.**
