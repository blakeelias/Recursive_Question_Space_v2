**Consider scientific knowledge, which is often based on extensive but finite empirical evidence and theoretical reasoning. Intuitively, we accept this as knowledge without requiring an infinite series of justifications.**, **If the absence of infinite reasons implies a lack of knowledge, then we would deny knowledge for many widely accepted scientific and everyday claims.**, **Denying the existence of all knowledge due to the impossibility of infinite reasoning seems contrary to our understanding and experiences.**
