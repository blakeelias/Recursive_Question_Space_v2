## Content

**Suppose a scientist develops a hypothesis, supported by a substantial amount of experimental data, which is true, yet unaware of an obscure study pointing to contrary evidence that isn't accurate. Intuitively, ignorance of this false evidence doesnâ€™t affect the truth and justification of the hypothesis.**, **If the lack of awareness of a defeater allows a truthful, justified belief to still count as knowledge, then the necessity of absence of defeaters seems questionable.**
