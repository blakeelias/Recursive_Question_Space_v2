## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition by sheer coincidence, yet they have the skill to generally form correct beliefs about such propositions. Intuitively, we either have to say that their belief is apt or that it is mere luck. If we say it is apt, we cannot account for the influence of luck, and if we say it is luck, we challenge the adequacy of apt belief as a marker of knowledge**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should exclude cases of luck, which burdens apt belief to fully exclude scenarios where luck plays an integral role**
