## Content

**Consider a scenario where a seasoned hiker confidently believes the path they are on leads safely home based on past experience, but unbeknownst to them, a recent landslide has altered the area such that their belief could have been easily false. Although intuitively they are at risk of error, they may still safely traverse due to coinciding circumstances. In such a case, we judge that they do not truly know they are on the correct path, questioning the idea that a belief's safety is always sufficient for knowledge.**
