## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief results in practical success solely because of specific circumstances, not because the belief is true, like using a broken compass that serendipitously points north**, **If we say practical success is evidence of truth, then truth becomes irrelevant to knowledge**, **If truth remains essential, then practical success without truth cannot establish knowledge**
