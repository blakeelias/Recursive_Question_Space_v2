## Content

**In mathematics, people often know propositions which are abstract and not causally linked as physical events are.**, **For instance, knowing that 2 + 2 = 4 involves no causal connection between mathematical entities and the belief.**, **Intuitively, such abstract truths are known without a causal connection, posing a challenge to causal requirements.**
