## Content

**Consider a case where a person holds a belief based on a deeply held prejudice that a particular stereotype about a social group is true.**, **Suppose that if this stereotype were false, the person's commitment to their prejudice would mean they would still believe it.**, **Since Sensitivity Theory requires belief not to persist if the proposition is false, it seems to incorrectly ascribe knowledge to prejudiced beliefs despite their lack of context-sensitive adjustment.**
