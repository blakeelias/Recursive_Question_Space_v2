**Suppose we have a scientist who accurately believes a complex theory that is true, but due to its complexity and the absence of immediate application, the theory does not lead to practical success. Intuitively, they still have knowledge of the theory.**, **There is a plausible principle that the truth of a belief does not guarantee practical usefulness as a criterion for knowledge, since knowledge can exist without immediate practical application.**
