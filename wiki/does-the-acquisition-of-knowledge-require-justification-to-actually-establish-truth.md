**Imagine a scenario where Martin reads about a historic event in a fictional novel, believes the event occurred, and it turns out to actually be a historical fact. Martin's belief is true and justified, in the sense he had a source, yet intuitively he does not possess knowledge of the event.**, **This suggests that for a belief to constitute knowledge, the justification should genuinely establish the truth of the belief in a reliable manner, indicating the insufficiency of merely any justified true belief.**
