## Content

**Consider a scenario where all individual components—belief, truth, and understanding reliability—are separately met, but their integration fails to track knowledge. Each seems necessary but none sufficient for complete reflective knowledge individually.**, **It is implausible that meeting these components individually suffices for reflective knowledge without synthesis into a coherent framework.**, **A plausible principle would necessitate an overarching cognitive coherence for true reflective knowledge.**
