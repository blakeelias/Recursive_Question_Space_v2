## Content

**Suppose in context C, a high standard of justification is needed to claim knowledge, while in context D, a lower standard suffices. Intuitively, the standards for justification should be clear and consistent for effective communication and understanding.**, **If different contexts endorse different justification standards without clear boundaries, people may find it difficult to determine when they truly know something.**, **Confusion can arise if people are unsure about which context is applicable for their knowledge claims, leading to misunderstandings.**
