## Content

**Suppose we have a case where different individuals have internally coherent yet mutually exclusive belief systems. Intuitively, we cannot say both individuals possess knowledge if their beliefs directly contradict each other and only one can be true.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, objectivity and consistency with external reality are necessary. Therefore, coherence confined to an individualâ€™s belief system might not suffice for knowledge.**
