## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition based on strong evidence, but part of the evidence is a false assumption. Intuitively, we might still want to say they know the proposition if their belief turns out true accidentally due to true remaining evidence.**, **In some cases, the fortuitous correctness of the belief, despite a false lemma, intuitively leads us to consider the belief as knowledge.**
