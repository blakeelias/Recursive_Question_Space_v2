**Consider a scenario where new evidence dramatically shifts a person's belief system, such as new scientific data negating prior understanding. During the transition, it might appear that they know the very data causing the shift, intuitively judging they possess knowledge of emerging truths despite temporary incoherence.**, **The acquisition of knowledge should allow for evolving belief systems, indicating that coherence is not the only factor determining truth and knowledge.**
