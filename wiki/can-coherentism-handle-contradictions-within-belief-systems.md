## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person holds a largely coherent belief system but also possesses a few contradictory beliefs. Intuitively, if these contradictions are minor, the person might still have knowledge.**, **It is implausible to require complete coherence when modest contradictions might persist in complex belief systems that still permit knowledge.**
