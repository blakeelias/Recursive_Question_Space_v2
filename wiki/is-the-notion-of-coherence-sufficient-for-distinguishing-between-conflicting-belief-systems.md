## Content

**Two distinct belief systems may both be internally coherent yet hold contradictory beliefs.**, **If coherence alone is relied upon for knowledge, then it provides no way to decide between two equally coherent systems that hold opposing truths.**, **This makes coherence insufficient as a sole criterion for truth because it cannot adjudicate between contradictory yet coherent systems, challenging the use of coherentism as a complete theory of knowledge.**
