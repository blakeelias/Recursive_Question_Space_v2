## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition is true because they guessed it correctly without any information. In such a scenario, intuitively we would not judge that they have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires not only truth and belief but also some form of justification beyond a causal link. This principle implies that causally connected but coincidentally true beliefs might fail to be knowledge.**
