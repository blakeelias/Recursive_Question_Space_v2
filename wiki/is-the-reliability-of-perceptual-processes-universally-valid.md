**Consider a scenario in which a person sees a mirage and has been trained to recognize this phenomenon correctly as an illusion in the past. Intuitively, we might hesitate to say that current perception alone affords knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that past configuration of cognitive processes shouldn't solely determine the reliability for current perceptual knowledge due to situational variances. This indicates a limitation in reliabilism which presumes stable cognitive reliability across situations.**
