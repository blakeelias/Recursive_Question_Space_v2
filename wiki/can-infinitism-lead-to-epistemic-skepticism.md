**If knowledge requires infinite justification, many or all of our everyday beliefs might potentially lack knowledge.**, **The requirement for infinite reasons could thus result in a skeptical view, where we are forced to concede ignorance concerning almost all or all beliefs.**, **If infinitism naturally leads to such skepticism, it calls into question its plausibility as a viable epistemological theory.**
