## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a false proposition that inadvertently leads them to a practically successful outcome. Intuitively, we might say they achieved success because of the false belief and not holding a true one.**, **It is plausible that practical success can sometimes be achieved through false beliefs, thereby challenging the necessity of the proposition being true.**
