**Consider a scenario where a person acquired knowledge through reliable methods and virtuous inquiry, but due to new discoveries, the previously 'true' proposition is debunked. Intuitively, prior to being disproved, the person seemed to know the proposition.**, **There is a plausible principle that due diligence and virtuous inquiry at a time when the proposition seems true can constitute knowledge, implying truth might not be strictly necessary.**
