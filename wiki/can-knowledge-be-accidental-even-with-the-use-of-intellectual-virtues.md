## Content

**Suppose a person exercises their intellectual virtues to predict stock prices using sophisticated analyses, and their predictions come true solely due to market manipulation by external factors unknown to them. Intuitively, these beliefs do not constitute knowledge because they are true by accident.**, **Consider a scenario where a scientist accurately predicts an experimental result due to intuition rather than thorough experimentation, and the result is true because of an unexpected interference they overlooked. Despite using intellectual virtues such as intuition, the resulting belief does not seem to qualify as knowledge.**
