## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief through a generally reliable process, such as vision, but is in an unusual environment where the conditions are manipulated, for instance, a room with uncanny illusions. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know the information derived from their vision in this case.**, **There is an intuition that knowledge requires a belief to not only be produced by a reliable process under normal conditions but also in the specific situation. If the situation is distinctly unreliable, knowledge seems absent even if the process is generally reliable.**
