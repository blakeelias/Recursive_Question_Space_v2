**Suppose a person once knew and had evidence for a certain truth but, due to memory loss, no longer remembers the evidence while still confidently holding the belief. Intuitively, we might hesitate to call this knowledge due to the lack of current evidence.**, **A belief that is no longer supported by accessible evidence may not arise from intellectual virtue, as the ongoing justification is absent.**
