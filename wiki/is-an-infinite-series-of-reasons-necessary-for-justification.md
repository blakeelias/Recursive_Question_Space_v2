**Consider a scenario where a person believes a proposition because they have a series of reasons, but the series is finite and highly reliable. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person is justified in their belief.**, **It is implausible to claim that an infinite series is necessary when finite chains of justification often suffice.**
