## Content

**It is implausible to suggest that an infinite series avoids circular reasoning when, practically, infinite chains might conceal implicit tautologies or circular loops.**, **Suppose a person provides an infinite series but some reasons in the series are covertly circular. Intuitively, such a series fails to effectively justify.**
