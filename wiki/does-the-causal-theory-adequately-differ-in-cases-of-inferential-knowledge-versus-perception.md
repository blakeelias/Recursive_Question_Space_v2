## Content

**Suppose a physicist knows a theoretical concept through extensive inferences rather than direct observation. Intuitively, such conceptual rather than perceptual knowledge should still be recognized, although causal connections might be indirect.**, **There is a plausible principle that logical or theoretical implications provide a form of causality aligned with comprehension, not requiring direct observation.**
