**Consider a scenario where a person is led to have a true conclusion on a matter due to overwhelming external evidence, even though they do not themselves believe the proposition. Intuitively, it seems their lack of belief undermines this as knowledge.**, **It is implausible to condition reflective knowledge necessarily on personal belief because one's environment may provide robust reasons for truth regardless of personal belief.**, **A plausible principle suggests that understanding alone, without belief, could ground reflective knowledge.**
