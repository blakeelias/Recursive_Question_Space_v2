**Suppose a person routinely uses a faulty clock that gives the correct time only by accident at noon.**, **When the person checks the clock at noon, they believe it is noon, and it is in fact noon, but the process is not generally reliable except occasionally by coincidence.**, **This situation poses a problem for the view that animal knowledge can be attained with reliability as a general condition without specifying degrees of reliability.**
