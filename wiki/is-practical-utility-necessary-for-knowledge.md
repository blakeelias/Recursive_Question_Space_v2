## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a belief is practically useful, it should consistently lead to successful prediction or action**, **Consider a scenario in which a person holds a true belief about a matter entirely irrelevant to their actions or success, such as the number of grains of sand on a distant planet. Intuitively, this is a case of knowledge even if the belief has no practical utility**, **It is implausible that the practical utility of a belief in unrelated contexts is required for knowledge**
