**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief that is true and caused by a reliable process, but there is no direct causal link between the fact making the belief true and the cognitive process. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not really have knowledge.**, **A reliable cognitive process is expected to generally connect the truth of the proposition to the person's belief in a robust manner.**, **The absence of a direct causal link between the belief and the truth questions whether knowledge is appropriately grounded, even if the process is generally reliable.**
