**Suppose someone believes the sun is shining based on both seeing sunlight and hearing a weather report. If the sunlight they see is actually an artificial reflection from a large mirror, they still hear the correct weather report. Intuitively, they might still be said to know the sun is shining.**, **This suggests that knowledge can survive incorrect causal paths if other paths remain intact, challenging the uniqueness of the causal requirement.**
