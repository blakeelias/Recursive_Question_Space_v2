**Suppose we have a case in which a person with cognitive impairment accurately predicts the weather, not from reasoning, but due to a reliable non-intellectual sensation. Intuitively, we would have to say that they know the weather despite the belief not arising from intellectual virtue, challenging the necessity of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**
