**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief through a reliable cognitive process but, due to luck, the belief happens to be true.**, **In this scenario, the true belief does not result from the reliability of the process but rather from sheer coincidence.**, **In cases of epistemic luck, it is not clear that the reliability of the process accounts for knowledge since the truth of the belief does not seem secured by the process reliability.**
