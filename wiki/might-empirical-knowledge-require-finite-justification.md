## Content

**Empirical knowledge is based on observation and empirical data, which seems adequately justified through finite reasons.**, **The application of a requirement for an infinite series of reasons to empirical knowledge might overcomplicate the basis of empirical validation.**, **If empirical knowledge is sufficiently justified without infinite reasons, the necessity of infinitism is thereby challenged for a significant domain of knowledge.**
