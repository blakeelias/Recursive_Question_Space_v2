## Content

**The possibility that every epistemic concept is analyzable into simpler terms challenges the notion that any single epistemic concept, including knowledge, could be primitive or unanalyzable.**, **Consider how concepts in other domains, such as biology with 'life,' were once considered primitive but were later analyzed into more basic components. Intuitively, this suggests a precedent for analyzing complex concepts into more foundational ones, challenging the status of knowledge as fundamental.**
