**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that justification for believing the proposition allows an infinite chain in principle but is constrained by practical limitations**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and justification allows for finite practical limits within an infinite framework**
