## Content

**Consider a scenario in which an individual forms a true belief based on evidence that would be defeated if a hidden but false piece of information were ever revealed. Intuitively, we might judge that this individual does indeed have knowledge.**, **The presence of a false potential defeater does not intuitively seem to undermine true belief, yet the focus of defeasibility is only on actual defeaters, which could exclude such cases as knowledge.**, **If knowledge can occur despite the hypothetical presence of false information, then the insistence on no true defeaters may be too restrictive.**
