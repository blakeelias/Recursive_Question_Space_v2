**Consider a scenario in which a person unknowingly uses accurate instincts to form a true belief without any conscious reflection or reasoning. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the person does not fully understand why they hold that belief, even if it turns out true.**, **It is implausible that people can be said to know something if their belief results from subconscious processes rather than deliberate intellectual engagement.**
