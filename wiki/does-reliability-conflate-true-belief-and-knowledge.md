**There is a plausible principle that for a belief to constitute knowledge, it must also involve an element of understanding or justification beyond mere truth. This principle together with the claim that reliability is the only necessary condition for knowledge entails that knowledge is reduced to just reliably produced true belief.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person has a true belief produced by a reliable process but lacks any understanding of why the belief is true, such as a person guessing an answer correctly. Intuitively, we would say that this is a true belief but not knowledge.**
