**Consider a case where a person has every reason to believe a proposition, and their belief successfully guides action, yet it later turns out the proposition is false.**, **In this situation, intuitively, the person seems to have knowledge prior to discovering the truth.**, **The necessity of truth for knowledge may be questioned if knowledge seems independent of current truth but relies more on justified correct action.**
