## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a true belief about a fact by guessing correctly. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief does not constitute knowledge, though the belief meets the conditions of truth and belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must exclude epistemic luck. This principle together with the fact that guessing correctly is a matter of luck entails that guessing does not count as knowledge.**
