**Suppose we have a case where a chess player makes moves intuitively based on instinct, resulting in victory. Intuitively, this seems more like luck than knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that decisions based heavily on intuition rather than skill do not always constitute knowledge, even if they are successful.**, **It is implausible to equate successful yet unskilled intuitive decisions with knowledge, as they might not arise from genuine cognitive aptitude.**
