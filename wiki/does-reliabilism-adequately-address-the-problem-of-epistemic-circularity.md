**There is a plausible principle that to know a proposition, one's justification for the belief must not rely on circular reasoning. This principle together with the claim that reliable processes can serve as justification entails that circularity might be involved when using the reliability as its own validation.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person trusts a cognitive process solely because it has been reliable in the past, a form of epistemic circularity. Intuitively, we would question whether such circular justification provides actual knowledge.**
