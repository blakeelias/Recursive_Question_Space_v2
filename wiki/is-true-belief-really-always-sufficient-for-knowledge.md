**Consider a scenario where a person forms a correct belief about an event due to accidentally overhearing a misleading statement, causing their belief to be true for the wrong reasons. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that they do not have knowledge.**, **For a belief to be apt, it must be accurate due to the individual's skill or competence, which is not the case in beliefs formed for the wrong reasons.**
