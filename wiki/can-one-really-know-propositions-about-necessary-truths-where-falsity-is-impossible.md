## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves avoiding error in forming beliefs. This means that if a belief's falsity is impossible, the belief normally seen as safe may not indicate true epistemic work on the part of the believer.**, **Consider a mathematical truth that a person believes correctly while the possibility of error is ruled out by the nature of the truth rather than any safe belief-forming process. Intuitively, we would hesitate to attribute knowledge if the safety condition plays no critical role, even though the proposition is true and the belief could not easily have been false.**
