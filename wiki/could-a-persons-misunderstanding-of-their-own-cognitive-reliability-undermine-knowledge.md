**It is implausible that a person can have knowledge without some awareness of the reliability of their cognitive processes.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition through a reliable process but erroneously believes that their cognitive processes are unreliable, perhaps due to doubt in their mental faculties. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or does not. If we say that the person knows, then their false belief about their reliability seems irrelevant to their knowledge. If we say they do not know, then knowledge appears to require an awareness of the reliability of one's processes.**
