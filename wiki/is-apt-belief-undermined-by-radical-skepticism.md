## Content

**Consider a scenario in which all beliefs are subjected to radical doubt, suggesting they could be generated by a deceiving power. Intuitively, apt beliefs might still arise under this skepticism, yet calling such beliefs knowledge is controversial, challenging whether aptitude can shelter beliefs from skeptical doubt and define them as knowledge**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge should display resilience against skeptical challenges, implying apt belief might be vulnerable to undermining skeptical scenarios**
