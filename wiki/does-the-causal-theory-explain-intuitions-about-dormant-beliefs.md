## Content

**Consider a person P who sees a rare bird and forms the belief it is a rare species. After many years, the belief remains true, and P encounters the bird again, confirming the belief. Intuitively, we would say P knew all along.**, **The causal connection was initially established but became dormant, raising questions about the continuity of the causal link required for knowledge over time.**
