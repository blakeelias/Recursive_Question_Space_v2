**Consider a case where a person arrives at a true belief solely through luck or coincidence, without intellectual virtue.**, **In such cases, the person lacks knowledge despite having a true belief and the involvement of intellectual virtues seems absent.**, **This suggests that intellectual virtue alone may not suffice to constitute knowledge if it lacks a justification component.**
