**Suppose we have a case in which a person holds a true belief with evidence free from any defeaters, yet their belief is influenced by cognitive biases, like confirmation bias. Intuitively, this influences the reliability of their belief, putting the integrity of their knowledge in question.**, **A principle that critical evaluation of cognitive biases is required for knowledge aligns with the intuition that merely defeating true defeaters does not guarantee genuine knowledge.**
