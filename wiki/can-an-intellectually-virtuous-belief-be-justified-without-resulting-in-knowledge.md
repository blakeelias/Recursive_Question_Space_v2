## Content

**Suppose a historian uses intellectual virtues of thoroughness and skepticism to conclude correctly on a historical event, but unbeknownst to them, crucial evidence they relied on is fortuitously accurate. Intuitively, this justified belief does not constitute knowledge due to the hidden dependency on luck.**, **Consider a detective following numerous intellectually virtuous procedures that lead to a correct conclusion about a suspect's guilt exclusively due to a lucky clue they misinterpret. Despite justification through intellectual virtues, their belief lacks the character of knowledge.**
