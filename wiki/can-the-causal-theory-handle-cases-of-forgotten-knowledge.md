## Content

**Consider a scenario where an individual once knew a fact but has forgotten the causal link that once supported true belief. Intuitively, they still know the proposition.**, **Forgetting certain elements of the causal link does not automatically negate knowledge, suggesting that the causal requirement is overly restrictive.**, **It is implausible that a lapse in memory of causal connections annihilates previously acquired knowledge that remains true.**
