**Consider a situation where a personâ€™s belief is true and meets conditions with an absence of defeaters, yet the method through which they obtain their belief is inherently unreliable and generally leads to falsehoods. Intuitively, we might judge this as an absence of knowledge.**, **It is implausible that the absence of defeaters for a justification alone guarantees knowledge, as the reliability of the belief-forming method plays a crucial role in actual knowledge acquisition.**
