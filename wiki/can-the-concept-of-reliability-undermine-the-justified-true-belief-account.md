**Imagine a person who reliably predicts outcomes due to consistent exposure to insider information, but holds a belief based on an unusual coincidence of correct guesswork when the insider information fails. Intuitively, we judge this instance not as knowledge, even with justified true belief, if the reasoning process ordinarily required for reliability wasn't active at that moment.**, **This implies that actual processes of reliable belief formation are required beyond what justified true belief captures.**
