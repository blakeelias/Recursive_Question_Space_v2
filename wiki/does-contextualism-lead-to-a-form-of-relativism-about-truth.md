**If the standards for justification vary, then a person might be seen as knowing a proposition in one context but not in another purely due to the differing standards.**, **Consider a scenario where a person is justified in believing it is raining because they see raindrops on the window. However, in a different context requiring meteorological instrumentation, they might not be considered to have knowledge.**, **Intuitively, the truth of the proposition that it is raining should remain constant regardless of context, suggesting an implausible relativism in truth if contextualism is true.**
