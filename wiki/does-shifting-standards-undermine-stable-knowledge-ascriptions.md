**If the standards for justification can vary depending on the context, then what is justified in one context might not be justified in another.**, **Suppose a context where the standards for justification are particularly low, and a person is considered justified in their belief.**, **In a different context where the standards are higher, it could happen that the same person with the same evidence would not be considered justified.**, **This variability suggests that whether a person knows something could change simply due to changes in context rather than changes in the actual evidence or proposition.**
