**Consider a situation where a person has a belief based on evidence produced by a reliable process, but the evidence itself is misleading and would typically lead to a false belief in other circumstances. Intuitively, it seems that the person does not truly know.**, **A reliable cognitive process is thought to deliver truth across similar contexts, but misleading evidence suggests that the link between the process and the truth is circumstantially weak.**, **While a process may be reliable, this does not guarantee knowledge if the specific evidence supporting belief is flawed.**
