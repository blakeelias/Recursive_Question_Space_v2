## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a scientist uses an erroneous method, yet arrives at the correct conclusion. Intuitively, scientific knowledge demands not just correct conclusions by skill but processes that are independently verifiable, implying that apt belief might not be sufficient for scientific knowledge because process and verification are ignored**, **It is implausible to consider the belief apt without accurate methodological validation, casting doubt on apt belief covering scientific truths**
