## Content

**It is implausible that individuals can always verify the absence of all true defeaters for their beliefs.**, **Suppose we have a case where someone has a justified true belief that lacks any known defeaters but may have unknown ones. It is overly demanding to require that all potential defeaters must be ruled out for knowledge.**
