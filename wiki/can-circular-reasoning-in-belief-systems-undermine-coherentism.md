## Content

**A system of beliefs can be coherent if each belief supports the others but may still be based on circular reasoning.**, **Circular reasoning, where a conclusion is supported by premises that assume the conclusion, is generally considered to be problematic and unreliable.**, **If circular reasoning is allowed within a coherent system of beliefs, it would mean the system of beliefs might not provide genuine justification for knowledge, challenging the claim that coherence suffices for justification.**
