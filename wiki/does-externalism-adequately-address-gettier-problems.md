**A Gettier scenario is one in which someone has a belief that is true and justified, yet it intuitively seems that they do not have knowledge. Examples include a person believing a proposition based on faulty reasoning that nonetheless happens to align with reality. The challenge is to explain how these beliefs don't constitute knowledge despite meeting typical criteria.**, **In Gettier cases, even if a belief is both true and formed by a generally reliable process, the accidental nature of the truth in these cases suggests there is a missing element preventing knowledge. Externalism's focus on reliability doesn't seem to address this gap adequately.**
