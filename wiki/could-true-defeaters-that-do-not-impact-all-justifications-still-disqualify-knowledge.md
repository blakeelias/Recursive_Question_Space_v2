## Content

**Consider a scenario where someone knows a mathematical fact based on solid proof, but an irrelevant fact about the mathematician's flawed character emerges. Intuitively, the person's knowledge remains intact, as character flaws don't defeat the proof.**, **There is a plausible principle that a true defeater must directly relate to the specific justification concerned. If true defeaters that do not impact all relevant justifications are considered, the criterion may unfairly obstruct knowledge.**
