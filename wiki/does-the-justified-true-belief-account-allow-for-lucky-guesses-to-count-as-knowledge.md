**Imagine a situation where someone randomly guesses the outcome of a coin flip, believes it, and turns out to be correct. Intuitively, we do not consider this knowledge because although the belief is true, the justification is insufficiently robust and reliant on mere luck.**, **This suggests that justified true belief fails to differentiate between knowledge and lucky guesses.**
