## Content

**Picture a scenario where a person uses a generally reliable but currently malfunctioning thermometer, which accurately reads the correct temperature by chance. Intuitively, they lack knowledge of the temperature when relying on faulty equipment.**, **A plausible principle stipulates that the reliability of the method or instrument must be consistently trustworthy to count as appropriately causally connected to the truth.**
