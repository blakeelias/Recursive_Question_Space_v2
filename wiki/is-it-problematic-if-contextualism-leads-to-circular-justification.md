## Content

**Consider a case where an individual's belief that they know a fact relies on the context-determined standard of justification, but the context itself relies on collective social knowledge of what the standards are. This foundational reliance can create a circular justification where context dictates what counts as knowledge, but what counts as knowledge can influence the recognized context.**, **Suppose you have a context where people defer to authority to set the standard of justification. Intuitively, if the authority itself derives its standard from a social convention of what is adequate justification, then the purported circularity might undermine the robustness and independence expected in an epistemic framework.**, **Justification and knowledge grounded in context alone might result in epistemic circularity, where context sets the standard, without external grounding that isn't context-contingent.**
