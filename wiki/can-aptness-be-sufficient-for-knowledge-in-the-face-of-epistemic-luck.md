## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person accurately predicts the outcome of a dice roll, believing based on an intuition. Intuitively, we would not consider this knowledge because the outcome is based on luck.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should be resistant to luck, suggesting a belief's aptness alone cannot guarantee knowledge.**, **Apt beliefs vulnerable to luck introduce an element inconsistent with the traditional understanding of knowledge.**
