## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which an individual forms a belief based on overwhelming evidence supporting a false proposition, but they simultaneously receive a minor piece of accurate evidence for the truth of the proposition they come to believe. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know because their belief is true and could not easily have been false, or that they do not know because the false evidence was misleading and could have caused them to believe otherwise. If we say they know, then knowledge seems too easily attained despite misleading circumstances. If we say they do not know, then we challenge the idea that non-falsity of the belief suffices for knowledge.**
