## Content

**If a person hears a fact from a credible authoritative source and believes it to be true, their knowledge seems to arise from testimony rather than a foundational belief. Intuitively, this challenges the necessity for foundational belief in every case of knowledge.**, **Consider a scenario where a person knows the time because someone else accurately asserts it; this belief is not foundational, yet intuitively it constitutes knowledge.**
