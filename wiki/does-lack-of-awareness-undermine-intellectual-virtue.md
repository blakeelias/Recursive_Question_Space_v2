## Content

**Suppose a person forms a true belief about a complex issue through deeply engrained biases that they are unaware of, like believing in stereotypes. Intuitively, we might not classify such beliefs as knowledge because they don't reflect critical or self-aware intellectual engagement.**, **Intellectual virtue commonly requires awareness of one's cognitive processes, suggesting that unawareness can negate the exercise of intellectual virtue essential for knowledge.**
