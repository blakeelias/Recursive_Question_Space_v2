**The closure principle suggests that if someone knows a proposition, and also knows that this proposition implies another, then they should know the other proposition as well.**, **Contextualism, by varying standards of justification, could create situations where the first proposition is known, but due to a stricter context, the implied proposition is not recognized as knowledge.**, **This seems to violate the intuitive closure principle because the implication seems clear, yet knowledge is inconsistently recognized.**
