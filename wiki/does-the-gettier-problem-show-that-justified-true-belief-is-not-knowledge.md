## Content

**Consider a scenario where Smith and Jones are applying for a job, and Smith has strong evidence that Jones will get the job, such as the employer's assurances. Smith also knows that Jones owns a Ford. Based on this, Smith forms the belief that the person who will get the job owns a Ford. However, unknown to Smith, Jones does not ultimately get the job, but Smith does, and coincidentally, Smith also owns a Ford. Intuitively, Smith does not know that the person who will get the job owns a Ford, despite having a justified true belief.**
