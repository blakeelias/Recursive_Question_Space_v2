## Content

**Suppose we encounter a case where all methods used to form a belief are independently reliable, and all evidence supports the belief. Even if a true defeater exists in some unrelated area, intuitively, we would say the belief still constitutes knowledge.**, **A justified belief is more about the relation between evidence and belief rather than the presence or absence of external truth factors that are potential defeaters.**
