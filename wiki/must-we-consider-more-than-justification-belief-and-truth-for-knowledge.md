## Content

**There is a plausible principle that for knowing a proposition, beyond justification, truth, and belief, it is required that the justification must be connected to the truth in a non-accidental way. This principle entails that justified true belief alone does not capture the essence of knowledge.**, **Consider a case in which a juror believes the accused is guilty based on strong, albeit misleading, evidence, and the accused coincidentally is guilty. Intuitively, we would judge that the juror's justified true belief did not constitute knowledge.**
