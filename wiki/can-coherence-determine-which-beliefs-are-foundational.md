## Content

**Suppose we have a case where several foundational beliefs are coherent with each other, yet intuitively, we must decide which belief underpins the entire system. If coherence cannot aid in determining the fundamental belief, then coherence alone is insufficient.**, **There is a plausible principle that foundational beliefs must be identifiable within a belief system for coherence to lead to knowledge. Therefore, if coherence fails to identify foundational beliefs, it undermines the knowledge claim.**
