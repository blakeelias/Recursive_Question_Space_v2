## Content

**Suppose a person hears a rumor that a specific company will merge, and coincidentally, this event occurs while they have no reliable source for this information. Intuitively, the person does not genuinely know about the merger.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can result from accidental events, where causation between belief and truth is purely coincidental rather than appropriately reliable or justified.**
