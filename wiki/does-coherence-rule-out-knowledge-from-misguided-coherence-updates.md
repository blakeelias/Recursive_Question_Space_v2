## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person updates their beliefs in a way that maintains overall coherence, but the new beliefs are based on misleading or faulty data. Intuitively, this does not result in knowledge.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can be updated merely by maintaining coherence with a changing system, particularly when changes are based on erroneous information.**
