## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not require infallible justification. This principle together with the notion that justifications can be defeated implies that defeasibility is too strict for ordinary knowledge claims.**, **Requiring that justification has no true defeaters might set the bar for having knowledge too high, potentially excluding most ordinary knowledge claims.**
