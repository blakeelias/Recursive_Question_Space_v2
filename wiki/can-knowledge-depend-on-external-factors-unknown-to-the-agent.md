## Content

**Consider a case where whether someone has knowledge depends on a remote fact they cannot possibly know about, such as an unknown defeater. Intuitively, it seems mistaken to say their knowledge is contingent on this unknown factor.**, **A requirement that knowledge depends on the lack of unknown true defeaters subjects knowledge claims to factors beyond the epistemic agentâ€™s control, which seems unreasonable.**
