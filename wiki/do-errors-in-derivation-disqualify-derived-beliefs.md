## Content

**It is plausible that a belief derived from foundational beliefs can be mistaken. If derivation includes errors, then even if the original belief is foundational and true, the resulting derived belief may not constitute knowledge.**, **Consider when someone miscalculates based on correct premises; they derive falsehood from truth, raising issues for derived beliefs as always sufficient for knowledge.**
