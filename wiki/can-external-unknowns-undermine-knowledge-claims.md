## Content

**Suppose an individual believes a certain true proposition based on valid reasons, but unbeknownst to them, there exists a true fact which would, if known, nullify their justification.**, **It seems implausible to claim that the presence of unknown external factors can negate one's claim to knowledge, especially when these factors do not affect the truth of the proposition itself.**
