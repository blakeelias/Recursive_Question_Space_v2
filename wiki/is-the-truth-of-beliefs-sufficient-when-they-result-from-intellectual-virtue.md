## Content

**There is a plausible conviction that a belief must involve more than true results from intellectual virtues; it should be resilient against accidental factors. This conviction together with the emergence of beliefs that are valid strictly due to fortunate coincidences—like predicting weather accurately due to an unnoticed anomaly—challenges the sufficiency of truth attained through virtues for declaring knowledge.**, **Imagine an astronomer forecasting celestial events through trusted virtuous means yet unknowingly relies on outdated ephemeris. Despite true predictions, the component of outdated information bars the full status of knowledge.**
