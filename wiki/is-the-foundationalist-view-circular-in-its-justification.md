**A plausible objection to foundationalism is that identifying a belief as foundational often involves some form of circular justification.**, **Consider a scenario in which a foundational belief is identified by its self-evidence, requiring itself to justify its own foundational status.**, **It is implausible that beliefs can be both foundational and free from circular reasoning, as foundational criteria often reference reasoning itself.**
