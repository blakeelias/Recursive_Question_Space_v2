## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person is in a low-stakes situation and claims to know a trivial fact, and they satisfy all low-context standards of belief, truth, and justification. Intuitively, we would judge that this person knows that fact.**, **Suppose we have a similar case where a person is in a high-stakes situation involving the same trivial fact. The stakes cause the person to doubt, and they do not satisfy the high-context standards for justification. Intuitively, we would question whether this person knows the fact.**, **It is implausible that the mere shift in context by introducing stakes or doubt changes whether a person knows a fact.**
