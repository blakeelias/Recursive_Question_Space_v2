**If the standards for justification vary depending on the context, this implies a dependency on many subjective factors such as the individual's assessment of the situation and external pressures.**, **A plausible principle of objectivity requires knowledge to remain consistent despite subjective fluctuations, such as personal pressure or interest variance.**, **Contextual variability undercuts the objectivity required for stable knowledge claims, resulting in undue subjectivity in determining justification.**
