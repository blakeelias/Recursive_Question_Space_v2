## Content

**Consider a scenario where multiple ambiguous or disjunctive causal pathways could lead to a true belief. This raises questions about which connection counts as knowledge-supporting.**, **Not all potential causal links ensure an unmistakable attribution of knowledge, challenging the ability to discern correctness.**, **Thus, there is an explanatory gap in establishing which causal conditions suffice unambiguously for knowledge.**
