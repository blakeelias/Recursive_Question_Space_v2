## Content

**It is implausible that intellectual virtue is necessary for knowledge because people who lack developed intellectual virtues, such as young children or animals, sometimes seem to know things.**, **If we accept that children or animals can have knowledge, then knowledge does not strictly require the exercise of full intellectual virtue as described in some epistemological theories.**
