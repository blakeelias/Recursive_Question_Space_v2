## Content

**Consider the coherence theory of truth, where propositions are justified by their coherence with a system of beliefs. A false lemma could be absorbed into this system without undermining knowledge.**, **For instance, astral navigation uses complex star maps; a mistaken star yet still leads to accurate navigation. The navigation system's success suggests a coherent system can justify knowledge even with small errors.**
