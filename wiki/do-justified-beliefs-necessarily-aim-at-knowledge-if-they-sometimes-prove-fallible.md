## Content

**Justification can sometimes be satisfied even in primitive societies where knowledge of logical rules or extensive evidence gathering is implausible due to resource constraints. Thus, justification does not always aim at knowledge, as understood in high-standard epistemic communities.**, **Consider a scenario where a person has a justified belief formed by rudimentary reasoning in a small tribe without access to modern scientific methods. Intuitively, we recognize this person's belief as justified, even if it might not meet all criteria to be knowledge by modern standards.**
