## Content

**Consider a scenario where a chess player uses intellectual virtue to anticipate the opponent's move accurately because of a flawed analysis that coincidentally aligns with truth. Intuitively, this does not lead to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should withstand potential errors in one's reasoning. This principle together with the possibility of forming beliefs that rely on flawed but virtuous reasoning processes, entails that exercising intellectual virtue alone may not suffice for knowledge.**
