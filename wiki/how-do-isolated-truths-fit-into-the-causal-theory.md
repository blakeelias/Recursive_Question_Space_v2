## Content

**A person might know an isolated truth due to coincidental correlation without a genuine causal link to the subject's belief.**, **Cases of isolated phenomena, like a distant quasar's properties, challenge the causal connection, as the belief could be a result of inference or theory rather than direct causation.**, **Knowledge of certain isolated truths through indirect observational methods does not feature a straightforward causal path.**
