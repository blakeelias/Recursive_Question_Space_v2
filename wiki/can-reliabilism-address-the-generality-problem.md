## Content

**Reliabilism faces the challenge of specifying which level of generality applies to the process that should determine its reliability. Any process can be described at various levels of generality, and variations in description can affect whether a process is deemed reliable.**, **Consider two distinct descriptions of the psychological process forming a belief, one specific and one broad. It is unclear which one reliabilism should consider for assessing reliability, thus challenging the determination of knowledge status.**
