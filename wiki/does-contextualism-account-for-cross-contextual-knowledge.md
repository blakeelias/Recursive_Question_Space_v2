**Suppose a person in a legal context claims to know a proposition with strict justification standards.**, **Later, this person claims the same knowledge in an informal setting, where the justification standard is looser.**, **If the knowledge claim in both contexts has to be coherent, contextual standards may either artificially inflate or deflate the epistemic value attributed to knowledge without clear justification.**
