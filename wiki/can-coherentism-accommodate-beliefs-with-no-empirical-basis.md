**A purely coherent system of beliefs can include beliefs that have no empirical or experiential basis.**, **If beliefs are not grounded in some form of empirical evidence, they risk being mere speculation or fantasy, which questions their status as knowledge.**, **The inclusion of non-empirical beliefs challenges whether coherence is a strong enough condition for knowledge without an empirical or external anchor.**
