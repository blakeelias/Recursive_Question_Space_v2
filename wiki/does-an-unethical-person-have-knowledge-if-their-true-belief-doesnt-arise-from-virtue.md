**There is a plausible principle that a person can believe a true proposition and still not have knowledge if their belief arises from unreliable, non-virtuous methods.**, **An example is a person who guesses answers on a test, gets them right, but did not exercise any intellectual virtue. In this scenario, intuitively, we would judge that the person does not have knowledge.**
