**Suppose a person believes that carrying an umbrella causes rain because they observe a correlation between taking an umbrella and it raining. The belief is true when it rains. Yet, intuitively, this does not constitute knowledge of the causal structure of rain.**, **Correlation, when not representing a genuine causal link of the correct type, fails to provide the kind of justification needed for knowledge.**
