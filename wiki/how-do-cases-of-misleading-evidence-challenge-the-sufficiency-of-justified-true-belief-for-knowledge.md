**Suppose a person has strong evidence that their friend is in town due to reliable reports and sightings, and they believe this proposition, which is also true. However, unbeknownst to them, the reports were all coincidental, and their friend was due to leave town but decided to stay for unrelated reasons. Intuitively, we would judge that they lack knowledge because the evidence, though justified, is misleading.**, **This implies that justified true belief can result from initial conditions that merely happen to align with the truth, without genuine knowledge being present.**
