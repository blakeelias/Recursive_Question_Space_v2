## Content

**If knowledge is fundamental, then conceptual links between it and other epistemic states such as belief, doubt, or certainty are less straightforward and potentially problematic.**, **Consider how understanding each epistemic state often relies on its relation to knowledge. If knowledge is designated as primitive, it complicates these interrelations, making it harder to explain and analyze other statesâ€™ roles within the epistemic framework. Intuitively, this setup undercuts coherent epistemic theory development.**
