**Higher-order evidence refers to evidence about the reliability of one's own evidence. A scenario could involve a person having justified belief, but then discovering evidence that suggests their original justification is unreliable. Intuitively, the person should still be able to maintain knowledge if the original belief happens to be true.**, **The existence of higher-order evidence raises questions about whether it always acts as a defeater, even when the original proposition is true.**
