**There exists a scenario where a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief is practically successful, yet the person is unaware of the evidence supporting the truth of the proposition.**, **In such a scenario, intuitively, the person lacks knowledge because the belief might merely be the result of luck rather than a true understanding or recognition of evidence.**
