**Consider a scenario where different cognitive processes have varying degrees of reliability, such as one person using a high-quality telescope observing a celestial event and another using a faulty one. In such a scenario, intuitively we would judge that the degree of reliability affects whether what is observed counts as known.**, **If degrees of reliability impact judgments of knowledge, then the binary interpretation of reliability as either present or absent might be insufficient for analyzing knowledge.**
