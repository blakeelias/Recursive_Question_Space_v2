**Consider a scenario where a person gains belief in a true proposition solely through testimony from a reliable source. The person does not independently have justification beyond trust in this source. Intuitively, it seems plausible to regard such cases as knowledge, yet they may lack independent justification from the believer.**, **An adequate account of knowledge should account for cases where testimonial transmission results in justified true belief being sufficient for knowledge despite the absence of direct justification by the individual.**
