**Effective communication about knowledge claims requires a shared understanding of what counts as sufficient justification.**, **When contextualism allows justification standards to vary, different contexts might lead to misunderstandings or disagreements about knowledge between people from these contexts.**, **This challenge arises in cross-contextual communication where one person's knowledge claim may not be recognized by another due to differing justification standards.**
