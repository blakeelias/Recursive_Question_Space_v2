**Consider an astronomer who predicts a solar eclipse based on astronomy and mathematics, not direct observation. The eclipse occurs as predicted. Intuitively, we would say the astronomer knows about the eclipse.**, **The use of abstract models and calculations to predict the event does not involve a direct causal path from the eclipse occurrence to the prediction, challenging the causal theory.**
