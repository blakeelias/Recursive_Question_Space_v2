**Consider a scenario in which a person believes they will win the lottery tomorrow, and they buy a ticket. Coincidentally, they win the lottery. Intuitively, the mere coincidence of having the true belief was due to luck, not knowledge.**, **It is plausible that a belief is justified if the person has a general belief that they will win based on a feeling or prior events, but the truth of the belief is merely coincidental and does not constitute knowledge.**
