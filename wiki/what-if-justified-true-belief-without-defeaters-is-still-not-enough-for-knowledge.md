## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition, has justification, and there are no true defeaters. This seems to align with the defeasibility theory conditions, yet intuitively, additional factors beyond these criteria appear necessary for true knowledge.**, **Consider the plausible principle that knowledge requires something more than just the absence of defeaters, such as reliability of the belief-forming process. This suggests the defeasibility theory might be incomplete.**
