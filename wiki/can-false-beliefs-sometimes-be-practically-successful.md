**Suppose an individual believes falsely that they are extremely talented at their job, which leads to increased confidence and actual success in their career. Intuitively, their false belief is practically useful but does not constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible to assert that practical success, when grounded in false belief, qualifies as knowledge.
