## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a belief system is coherent without relying on any empirical observation. Intuitively, knowledge seems to require more than coherence and should involve empirical observation or sensory input.**, **There is a plausible principle that empirical observation is a necessary aspect of obtaining knowledge, one which coherence alone can't fulfill.**
