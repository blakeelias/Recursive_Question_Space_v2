## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge claims should be consistent.**, **Suppose we have two different contexts with varying standards of justification: in the first context, a person is justified in believing a proposition; in the second context, they are not. Intuitively, either the person knows the proposition in the first context, or they don't in the second.**, **This variance between contexts violates the principle of consistency in knowledge claims, leading to a potential paradox when the same knowledge claim is evaluated differently.**
