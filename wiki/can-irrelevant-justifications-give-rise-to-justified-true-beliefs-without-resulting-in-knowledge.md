**Consider a scenario where a scientist, Dr. Kim, believes a chemical reaction will occur due to an incorrect theory but evidence coincidentally supporting her belief emerges from an unrelated interaction in the experiment. This makes her belief true and apparently justified. Intuitively, Dr. Kim does not have knowledge of the reaction based on the unrelated evidence.**, **This implies that merely possessing a justified true belief is insufficient if the justification does not appropriately account for the belief's truth, questioning its sufficiency for knowledge.**
