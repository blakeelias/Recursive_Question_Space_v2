## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a belief coheres internally but differs in its validity across contextsâ€”valid in one scenario and invalid in another. Intuitively, coherence alone seems insufficient to address context-specific aspects of knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge must be robust across various relevant contexts, not just within a coherent belief system.**
