## Content

**Imagine a scenario where an individual has a justified true belief but lacks the cognitive capacity or resources to consider an extensive set of potential true defeaters. Intuitively, we might say they still have knowledge.**, **The claim that justification must have no true defeaters implies an unrealistic demand on individuals to adequately assess numerous potential challenges to their knowledge.**, **If knowledge relies too heavily on a person's ability to evaluate a potentially infinite array of defeaters, it might set an unattainable standard for ordinary knowers.**
