**A case in which one person claims to know a proposition "p" under low contextual standards, while another denies knowledge of "p" under high standards suggests knowledge depends merely on context. Intuitively, this appears contradictory because "p" cannot be both known and unknown.**, **There is a principle that known propositions should remain consistent across different contexts. This principle implies that varying standards violate the consistency requirement.**
