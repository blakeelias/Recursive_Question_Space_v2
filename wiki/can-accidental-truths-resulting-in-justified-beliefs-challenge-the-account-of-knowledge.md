**Suppose a person, John, finds a lottery ticket and checks the results online. Due to a typographical error on the website, the winning numbers displayed match John's ticket. John believes he has a winning ticket, thus having a justified true belief. However, when the website is corrected, this belief turns out to have been true only by accident. Intuitively, we judge that John never truly knew he had won the lottery.**
