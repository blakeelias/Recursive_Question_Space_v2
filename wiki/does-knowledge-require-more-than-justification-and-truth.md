**Suppose a case in which a person forms a true belief that is justified by apparent evidence, but this justification is entirely misleading and irrelevant to the truth of the belief. Intuitively, we might judge that the person lacks knowledge, suggesting that mere conjunction of truth, belief, and justification is inadequate for knowledge.**, **A plausible principle is that genuine knowledge must involve a further relation between truth, belief, and justification, such as a causal or evidential connection that grounds the justification firmly with the truth of the belief.**
