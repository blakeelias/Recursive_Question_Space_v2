**There exists a plausible situation in which a proposition is known despite one of the supporting beliefs being false. If the overall structure of justification accommodates this, a person might still know the proposition.**, **Suppose someone knows their friend is at the library because they saw their friend's unique bike outside, although the bike was not their friend's, yet coincidentally the friend was indeed at the library at that time. This suggests that false assumptions may not always preclude knowledge.**
