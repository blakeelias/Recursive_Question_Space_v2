**Suppose a case where someone knows a complex mathematical theorem by correctly deriving it from false premises they know to be false. Intuitively, they still know the theorem.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge can result from processes or methods, such as reliable reasoning, that do not require foundational beliefs. This principle challenges the necessity of foundational beliefs for knowing propositions.**, **One may know that a bird is a canary because they are reliably informed by an expert, regardless of whether this belief is foundational or based on foundational beliefs.**
