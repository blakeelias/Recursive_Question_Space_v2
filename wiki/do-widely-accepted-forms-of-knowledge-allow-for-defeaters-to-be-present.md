**Consider common knowledge scenarios where people know everyday facts like the Earth orbits the Sun, despite potential defeaters like philosophical skepticism about sense data. Intuitively, people do have knowledge in these cases.**, **There is a plausible principle that widely accepted knowledge often admits possible defeaters without losing its status as knowledge. This principle stands in contrast to the demand for an absence of defeaters.**
