## Content

**Consider a case where a strategy believed to be effective due to misunderstandings incidentally leads to success; the belief lacks truth despite its utility. Intuitively, the belief is successful without being true knowledge.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true.**, **It is implausible to conclude that practical success alone suffices for truth-required knowledge.**
