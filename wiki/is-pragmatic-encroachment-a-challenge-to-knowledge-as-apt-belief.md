**Pragmatic encroachment suggests that practical circumstances can influence whether one has knowledge. In high-stakes situations, although a belief might be apt, the practical implications might lead us to deny knowledge.**, **If pragmatic factors can alter the epistemic status of a belief, aptness alone seems insufficient for determining knowledge, since the practical stakes interplay with epistemic evaluations.**
