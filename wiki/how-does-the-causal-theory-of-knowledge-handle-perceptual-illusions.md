**In cases where a perception leads to a true belief through coincidence or luck, there may be a causal connection, but this may not constitute knowledge.**, **For instance, seeing something that appears to be a lake and believing it is a lake, when in fact it is a mirage over actual water far away, challenges the idea of an appropriate causal link.**
