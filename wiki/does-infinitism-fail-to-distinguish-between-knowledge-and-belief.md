## Content

**Suppose we have a case where someone claims to believe a proposition and claims their series of reasons is infinite. Intuitively we have to say that saying something is believed based on infinite reasons does not automatically mean it is known.**, **Believing with infinite reasons does not necessarily differentiate between mere belief and knowledge since knowing also requires truth.**
