## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that their friend has arrived at a party because they see their friend's car parked outside the house. However, unbeknownst to them, the friend has lent the car to someone else. Intuitively, the person does not know their friend is at the party, despite meeting the conditions of belief and truth.**, **A plausible principle is that knowing a proposition requires direct or reliable information; seeing a parked car is indirect when the car might be used by someone else. This principle suggests lack of an appropriate causal connection even if belief and truth are present.**
