**Consider a scenario where a person has a coherent belief system that is entirely disconnected from reality, such as the beliefs of a consistent but delusional thinker. Intuitively, these coherent beliefs do not amount to knowledge of the real world.**, **There is a plausible principle that for beliefs to amount to knowledge, there must be some interaction or correlation with the external world. This principle suggests coherentism might miss this requirement.**
