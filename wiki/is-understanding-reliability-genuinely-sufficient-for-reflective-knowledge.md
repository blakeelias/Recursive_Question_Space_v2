**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition due to an erroneous reasoning process but possesses a higher-order understanding of the reliability of belief. Intuitively, this does not qualify as reflective knowledge because the foundational belief process was flawed.**, **There is an intuition that reflective understanding should account for the entire knowledge process, not just the belief reliability.**, **A plausible principle suggests reflective knowledge should include accuracy and reliability of reasoning, not just understanding reliability.**
