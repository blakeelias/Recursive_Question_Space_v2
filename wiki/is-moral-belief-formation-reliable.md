**Consider a scenario where a person forms a belief about what is morally right through a culturally biased but truth-conducive process. Intuitively, such beliefs may not easily qualify as knowledge due to potential moral disagreement and bias.**, **It is implausible that a belief formed purely through culturally dependent processes without cross-cultural validation can be reliably classified as knowledge. This claim questions whether the reliability of moral cognition processes uniformly ensures knowledge.**
