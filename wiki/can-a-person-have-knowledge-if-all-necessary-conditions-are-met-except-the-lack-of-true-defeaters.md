**It is plausible to consider a situation where a person believes a proposition, the proposition is true, and the person has justification for believing it, but their justification has true defeaters that they are unaware of.**, **In such a situation, intuitively, it could still be argued that the person knows the proposition despite the presence of unknown true defeaters.**
