## Content

**Suppose we have two isolated communities with internally coherent but mutually exclusive belief systems about a natural phenomenon. Intuitively, we would hesitate to regard both as having knowledge if they contradict each other.**, **There is a plausible principle that the truth of a belief system might depend on factors external to its coherence, highlighting the insufficiency of coherence alone for knowledge.**
