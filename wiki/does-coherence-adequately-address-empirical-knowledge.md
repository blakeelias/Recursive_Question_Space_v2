## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a personâ€™s abstract theoretical beliefs cohere internally but lack empirical support or observation. Intuitively, this does not contribute to empirical knowledge.**, **It is implausible that coherence with an internally consistent system alone suffices for knowledge of empirical matters, without observational or experiential anchors.**
