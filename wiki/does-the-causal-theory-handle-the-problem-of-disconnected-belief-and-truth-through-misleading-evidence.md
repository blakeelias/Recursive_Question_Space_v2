## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person, due to fake news fabrications they are unaware of, believes a proposition that happens to be true. Intuitively, their belief does not constitute knowledge because the truth was arrived at through misleading evidence.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires that the grounds for belief must be truth-tracking, meaning the information reliably leads to truth, which the misleading evidence fails to provide.**
