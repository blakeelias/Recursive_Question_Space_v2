## Content

**Consider a hypothetical situation where a person holds a justified true belief, but there is always the theoretical possibility of unknown defeaters arising indefinitely.**, **Intuitively, if knowledge depends on the absolute impossibility of defeaters, it suggests that knowledge is potentially unattainable due to the infinite regress of possible challenges.**
