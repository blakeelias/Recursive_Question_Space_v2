**It is implausible to assert knowledge of something that is not true, as the concept of knowing something necessarily involves it being a fact about the world. If we allow false propositions to count as knowledge, it undermines the very purpose of seeking truth.**, **In thinking about scientific hypotheses that are yet to be proven, someone might have good reason to accept one as true. However, if it turns out to be false, we intuitively consider their belief not to be knowledge.**
