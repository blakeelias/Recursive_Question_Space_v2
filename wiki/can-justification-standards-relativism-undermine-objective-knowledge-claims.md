## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person claims to know a fact based on their context-specific standard of justification, while another person using a different standard disputes their knowledge. Intuitively, if knowledge is reliant on personal or contextual standards, it threatens the objectivity of what is claimed to be known.**, **It is implausible that knowledge, being a pursuit of truth, should be swayed by subjective or variable notions of justification, as this undermines the unity and objectivity of knowledge.**
