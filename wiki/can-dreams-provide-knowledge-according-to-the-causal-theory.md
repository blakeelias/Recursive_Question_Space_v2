**Suppose an individual dreams about a specific friend visiting vividly, and upon awakening, they find it to be true without any prior indication that the friend was coming. The belief regarding the visit is suddenly true, and while the individual believes it, the causal nexus between the event and the belief instigated by a dream remains nebulous.**, **Dream experiences present a case where causation relies on less direct physiological or neurological processes â€” presenting a challenge for the necessity of a direct causal pathway required by the theory.**
