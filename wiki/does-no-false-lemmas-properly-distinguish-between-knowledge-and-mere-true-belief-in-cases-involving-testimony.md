## Content

**Envision a situation where a person accepts a truth based on credible testimony without any false belief involved. If the testimony incidentally turns out to be deceptive but still results in a true belief, intuitively we question if it constitutes knowledge.**, **A belief formed purely from reliable but accidentally correct testimony, devoid of false lemmas, seems to lack the robustness typically required for knowledge, challenging the adequacy of 'No False Lemmas' in these contexts.**
