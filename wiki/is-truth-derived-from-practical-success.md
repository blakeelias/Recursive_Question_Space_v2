## Content

**A proposition can be practically successful because it creates expectations that are met in practice, yet not be true in an ontological or factual sense.**, **In these cases, practical success does not necessarily reflect the actual truth of a proposition, calling into question whether practical success is a valid component of the sufficiency condition for knowledge.**
