## Content

**Consider a scenario where an archer hits a target with skill, but the bullseye is removed after the arrow is released, unbeknownst to the archer. Intuitively, we would not say the archer's shot was apt, as the outcome was not determined by skill, thereby suggesting that an adroit or accurate act might not lead to aptness under conditions of luck**, **A plausible principle is that apt belief requires not only accuracy due to ability but also that the conditions must be favorable in a non-lucky way, suggesting situations could arise where beliefs are apt yet might not be considered knowledge**
