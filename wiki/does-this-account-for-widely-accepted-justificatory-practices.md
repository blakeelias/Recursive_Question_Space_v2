## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on scientific evidence, which turns out to be true, but they were unaware of their own ability to assess evidence effectively. Intuitively, we would judge this as a case of knowledge, but it is unclear if the belief would count as adroit or apt without awareness of one's abilities.**
