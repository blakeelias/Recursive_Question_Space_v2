## Content

**Consider a case where a person logically infers a belief from solid evidence that has no known true defeaters. Intuitively, it's still possible that future discoveries could create true defeaters unbeknownst to them.**, **The requirement for justification without any true defeaters implies that knowledge is permanently provisional since unforeseeable future evidence could always become a defeater.**, **If the status of knowledge is always vulnerable to unknown future events, this challenges the stability of claiming knowledge at any time.**
