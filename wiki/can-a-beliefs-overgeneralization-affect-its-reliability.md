**Consider a belief formed by a reliable process concerning a specific scenario, but this belief is inappropriately generalized to a broader context without similar support. Intuitively, this does not seem to qualify as knowledge.**, **A reliable process knows the limits of its generalizations and maintains accurate beliefs across similar situations.**, **If a belief is overgeneralized without justifiable reliability, its claim to represent knowledge is compromised despite initial reliability.**
