## Content

**There is a plausible principle that finite chains of justification can adequately support beliefs. This principle together with a denial of infinite chains of justification suggests that knowledge can be justified without infinite regress.**, **Suppose we have a case in which a person has a true belief about an everyday fact based on a few good reasons. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the fact without requiring an infinite set of reasons.**
