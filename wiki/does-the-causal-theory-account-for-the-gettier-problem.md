**Consider a case where a person is driving through a fake barn area. They see a real barn amidst several fake ones and form the belief that there is a barn. The belief is true and causally connected to the real barn. Intuitively, the person does not have knowledge due to the misleading presence of fake barns.**, **In cases where the environment introduces elements that undermine the reasoning process leading to belief, causality alone does not seem to suffice for knowledge.**
