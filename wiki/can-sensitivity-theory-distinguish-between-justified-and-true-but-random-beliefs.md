## Content

**Consider someone flipping a coin and forming a belief about the outcome being heads without checking, which happens true by sheer luck.**, **Suppose if this outcome were to not occur, without further check, they might still hold their belief based on mere confidence.**, **Sensitivity's criterion sounds deficient here, seeming to equate this random yet true belief with knowledge lacking systematic justification.**
