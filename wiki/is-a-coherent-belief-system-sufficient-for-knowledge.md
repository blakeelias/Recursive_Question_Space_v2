**Consider a scenario where a person's belief system is entirely consistent and mutually supportive but based on a fictional story. Intuitively, we would judge that this person does not possess knowledge because the beliefs do not correspond to reality.**, **There is a plausible principle that for knowledge, beliefs must correspond to the external world to ensure they are not based on complete fiction. This principle, together with the claim that coherence within a belief system can occur irrespective of truth, suggests that coherence alone cannot guarantee knowledge.**
