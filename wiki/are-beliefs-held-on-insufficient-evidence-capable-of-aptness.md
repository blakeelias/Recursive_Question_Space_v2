**Consider a person who forms a belief based on irrational or minimal evidence, yet coincidentally, the belief turns out true and believed accurately.**, **The beliefâ€™s accuracy might yield aptness, but it arose from insufficiency rather than adroitness.**, **A belief appearing apt without sufficient evidence questions whether aptness alone can satisfy knowledge requirements.**
