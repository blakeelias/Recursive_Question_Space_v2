**Suppose a person believes it is raining outside because they mistakenly think they heard the rain, but it is actually raining outside due to a different reason. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it is raining.**, **Even if the belief is true and justified in the person's mind, the justification is flawed, indicating that deceptive justification scenarios challenge the sufficiency of justified true belief for knowledge.**
