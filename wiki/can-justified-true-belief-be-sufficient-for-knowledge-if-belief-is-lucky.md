## Content

**Suppose a person believes a proposition due to a hunch, it turns out true, and they have various supporting pieces of evidence, some of which are actually false. Intuitively, despite the reliance on false evidence, we might say the person has knowledge.**, **The 'no false lemmas' condition suggests the presence of any false evidence negates the possibility of knowledge, but this conflicts with the intuition that the true belief is knowledgeable.**
