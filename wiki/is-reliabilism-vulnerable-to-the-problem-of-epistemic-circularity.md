**Epistemic circularity occurs when the reliability of a cognitive process is justified by using that very process. Reliabilism seemingly does not prevent using unreliable processes to justify themselves, thus potentially undermining its criteria for reliable processes.**, **For example, suppose a person forms a belief about the reliability of their senses by using their senses themselves. Intuitively, such a process cannot reliably justify its reliability independently.**
