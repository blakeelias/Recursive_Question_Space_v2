## Content

**Imagine a scenario where a person believes a proposition because of a reliable method and the proposition is false, such as believing a news source that somehow errors. Intuitively, we would judge they do not have knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires truth in addition to any causal connection, indicating that believing falsehoods caused by reliable processes does not count as knowledge.**
