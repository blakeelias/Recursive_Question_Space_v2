## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a true belief through a justified false belief which is accidentally corrected. Intuitively, either we have to say they know or they do not know. If we say they know, this contradicts the intuition that luck undermines knowledge. If we say they do not know, then a true, adroit belief is overinclusive for knowledge.**
