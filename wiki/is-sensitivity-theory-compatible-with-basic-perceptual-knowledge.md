## Content

**Consider a case where a person looks at the sky on a clear day and believes it is blue. Intuitively, they believe the proposition the sky is blue based on immediate perception.**, **If in a nearby possible world the person looks at the sky on a slightly overcast day, they might still believe it is blue even if it is not completely clear.**, **The need for the belief to not hold in a false case suggests Sensitivity Theory might incorrectly deny ordinary perceptual beliefs count as knowledge.**
