## Content

**Suppose we have a situation where a person knows a fact due to a direct causal connection, like seeing raindrops to know it's raining. Intuitively, we understand that justified true belief requires this causal link for knowledge, beyond just justification and truth.**, **Knowledge arguably requires more than justified true belief by also needing a proper causal connection between belief and truth, which justified true belief alone might fail to ensure in certain cases.**
