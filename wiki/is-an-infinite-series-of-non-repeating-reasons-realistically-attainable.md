**In everyday life, people often make knowledge claims based on finite reasoning, such as a doctor diagnosing a patient based on symptoms, tests, and medical history. This suggests that infinite reasoning is not a practical requirement for knowledge.**, **A realistically attainable justification should be able to be completed within a finite lifetime, but an infinite regress of reasons cannot be completed in this way.**, **An infinite series of reasons seems to entail that no actual knowledge is possible because no human could possess or articulate such a series.**
