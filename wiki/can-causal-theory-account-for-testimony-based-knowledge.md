## Content

**In cases of knowledge via testimony, a person may correctly believe and know a proposition based on a speakerâ€™s assertion without a direct causal link between their belief and the original fact.**, **A listener receiving testimony about an event they were not present for relies on trust rather than a causal connection between the event and their belief.**, **Testimony introduces a challenge for causal theory because it requires a network of trust and transmission that might not meet the direct causal requirement.**
