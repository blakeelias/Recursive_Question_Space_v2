## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person remembers a past event accurately but the original causal source is no longer present. Intuitively, we would judge that the person knows the fact based on memory.**, **For memory-based knowledge, the original causal connection is lost, yet we consider memory as a conduit for retaining knowledge over time.**, **Memory serves as a valid route for knowledge retention that seemingly bypasses the direct causal criterion.**
