## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a scientist discovers a novel fact that contradicts current scientific theories but is later proven true through evidence. Initially, intuitively, we might judge that the scientist knows this fact based on evidence despite the lack of coherence with existing beliefs.**, **It is plausible that coherent beliefs are not the sole basis for knowledge, as evidenced knowledge can exist independently of current belief systems.**
