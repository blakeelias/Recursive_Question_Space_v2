## Content

**Suppose a person is an exceptional dart player and believes they will hit the bullseye, which they do, but a sudden gust of wind, unknown to them, corrects the dart's path. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows they will hit the bullseye or that they do not. If we say they know, then we must accept that knowledge can result from a mismatch between belief and skill. If we say they do not know, then their belief lacks the necessary connection to skill.**
