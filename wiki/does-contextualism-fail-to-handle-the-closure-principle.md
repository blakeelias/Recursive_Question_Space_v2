**The closure principle in epistemology states that if a person knows a proposition and this proposition entails another, the person should also know the other proposition.**, **Contextualism allows that a person might know a proposition with certain justification standards but not know an entailed proposition if the standards change.**, **This could lead to scenarios where the closure principle appears violated because the standards shift between propositions, contradicting the common intuitive appeal of closure.**
