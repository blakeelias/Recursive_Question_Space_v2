**Consider a situation where a person correctly believes a complex scientific theory due to a trustworthy testimony but without understanding why the theory is true. Intuitively, we might doubt that the person truly knows the theory despite having an apt belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that understanding requires more than just truth-conducive belief; it requires grasping relationships within a body of information. This suggests that knowledge might require more than an apt belief, indicating a shortfall in the aptness account.**
