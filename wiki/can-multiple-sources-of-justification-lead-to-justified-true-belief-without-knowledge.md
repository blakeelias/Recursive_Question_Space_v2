## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person forms a belief about a phenomenon based on multiple, non-independent sources that all derive from a single origin. Intuitively, the person has justified true belief, but given the lack of independent validation, this does not amount to knowledge.**, **A principle that knowledge requires independent corroboration from multiple sources differs from a basic justified true belief criterion, indicating additional complexity in knowledge acquisition.**
