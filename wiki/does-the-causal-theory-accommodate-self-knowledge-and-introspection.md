**Imagine a scenario in which a person believes they are in pain due to directly feeling it. This belief does not rely on an external causal chain but rather on introspection and self-awareness.**, **In cases of self-knowledge like recognizing one's own pain, there may lack an external causal link, but intuitively the person knows their condition, questioning the need for such a causal connection for all knowledge.**
