## Content

**Consider a case where a person thoroughly investigates evidence and concludes a defendant is guilty, based on misleading but convincing evidence.**, **If the proposition of guilt were indeed false, perhaps due to tampered evidence, the person's belief might persist due to the same appearance of validity.**, **Sensitivity Theory requires belief cessation if false, challenging in contexts of legal or investigatory scenarios where evidence seems certain but misleads.**
