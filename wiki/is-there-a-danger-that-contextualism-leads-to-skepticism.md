## Content

**Consider a scenario where every context has subtly different standards for justification, leading to the constant possibility that one never truly knows anything, if a higher standard is always conceivable. Intuitively, if knowledge changes with every conceivable context, then a form of skepticism about what we can truly know arises.**, **It is implausible that knowledge can withstand constant shifts in standard without collapsing into skepticism, as knowledge is meant to provide a stable basis for belief and action.**
