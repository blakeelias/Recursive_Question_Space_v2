## Content

**A case in which a person observes an event through a distorting medium, but correctly infers the true state of affairs, raises questions of knowledge. Intuitively, despite the distortion, they are seen as having knowledge if their belief is true.**, **Perceptual beliefs affected by unreliable conditions may accidentally align with truth, challenging the necessity for a proper causal link.**, **Even distorted perceptual beliefs can be considered knowledge despite the causal irregularity, if they manage to yield correct beliefs.**
