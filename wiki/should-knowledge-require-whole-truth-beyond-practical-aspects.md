**Suppose an investor believes a particular stock will rise due to limited visible factors and their belief becomes practically useful when the stock rises. However, they are unaware of other underlying causes for the stock's rise. Intuitively, they lack full understanding even if their belief is partially true and practically useful.**, **There is a plausible principle that full understanding and knowledge go beyond practical outcomes and involve comprehensive truth.**
