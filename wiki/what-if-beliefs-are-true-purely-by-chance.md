**Imagine Tom, who throws a dart blindfolded at a target forest, hears a sound that sounds like the dart hitting a bullseye. He believes with confidence he hit the bullseye. Unbeknownst to him, the sound was deceptive, but by pure luck, the dart did hit the bullseye. Although Tom has a justified true belief because he heard a sound and the dart did hit, intuitively, he does not know he hit the bullseye due to the element of chance.**
