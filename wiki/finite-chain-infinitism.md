**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that justification for believing the proposition involves a potentially infinite chain of reasons, even though this chain can be finite in practice**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and justification involves a finite yet appropriately open-ended chain of reasons**
