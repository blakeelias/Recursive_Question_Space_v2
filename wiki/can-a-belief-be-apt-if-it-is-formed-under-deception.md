**Consider a scenario where a person is the victim of a convincing deception but arrives at a true belief due to their own ability to reason. Intuitively, we would be tempted to say that their belief is not knowledge because the accuracy resulted under deceptive conditions, challenging whether the belief can truly be apt if it's formed through manipulation**, **It is implausible to affirm that a belief formed under extensive deception could be considered knowledge simply because it is accurate due to personal skill, as the deception undermines the connection between skill and outcome**
