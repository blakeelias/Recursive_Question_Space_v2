## Content

**Many scientific theories are initially based on assumptions or lemmas that are eventually revised or proven false as more data becomes available.**, **Despite such false lemmas, scientific theories are still considered knowledge during their time of acceptance because they reliably explain and predict phenomena.**, **If false lemmas disqualify a belief as knowledge, then much scientific knowledge historically recognized would not qualify as knowledge.**
