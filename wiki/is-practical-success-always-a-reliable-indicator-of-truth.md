**A belief can be practically successful or useful without necessarily being true, such as in cases of placebo effects in medicine where a treatment works due to belief rather than truth**, **There is a plausible principle that true beliefs reliably lead to desired outcomes, but utility in practice does not always entail the truth of a belief**, **The assumption that practical success necessarily follows from truth is challenged by scenarios where beliefs achieve success despite being false**
