## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person accidentally forms a true belief without any rigorous investigation or intellectual virtue, such as by guessing. Intuitively, we would say the true belief did not arise from an exercise of intellectual virtue.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief can be true purely by chance. This principle, together with the necessity for intellectual virtue, suggests that not all true beliefs are due to intellectual virtues.**
