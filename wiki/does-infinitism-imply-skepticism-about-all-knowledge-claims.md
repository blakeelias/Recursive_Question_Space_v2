**Suppose there are no finite chains of reasoning sufficient for knowledge. This would imply that we cannot have knowledge about anything, since infinite reasons cannot be produced or verified.**, **If all knowledge requires an infinite chain of reasons, then skepticism about our knowledge of the external world or scientific facts becomes inescapable.**, **It seems contradictory to assert that we have knowledge while also requiring an unreachable standard such as an infinite regress of reasons.**
