## Content

**A case in which a person believes a proposition that is true but the belief does not arise from the exercise of intellectual virtue is not a case in which the person lacks knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that a true belief can result from luck or coincidence and still be considered knowledge, contrary to the requirement of it arising from intellectual virtue.**
