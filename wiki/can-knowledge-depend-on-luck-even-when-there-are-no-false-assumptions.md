## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a lucky guess that turns out to be true, and this belief is justified by unrelated evidence that is neither true nor false. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows or that they do not know. If we say the person knows, then knowledge depends on luck, which undermines the reliability of the belief. If we say they do not know, then justification and truth without false assumptions are insufficient for knowledge.**
