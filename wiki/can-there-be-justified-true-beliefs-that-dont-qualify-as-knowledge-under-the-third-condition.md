**Consider a case in which a person has a justified true belief about a proposition due to empirical evidence, but a hidden true defeater exists they are unaware of. Intuition suggests they know the proposition, despite the hidden defeater.**, **True beliefs based on solid justification can still fail the defeasibility criterion, even though they seem to fit ordinary notions of knowledge.**
