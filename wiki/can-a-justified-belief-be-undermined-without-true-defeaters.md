## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified belief in a proposition based on strong evidence. A true defeater is discovered later, unrelated to the evidence the person had. Intuitively, we would judge that the initial belief was undermined even before the true defeater was discovered.**, **Knowledge should not depend solely on the existence of true defeaters but also on the quality and context of the justification itself.**
