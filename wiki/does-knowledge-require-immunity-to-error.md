**It is implausible that knowledge requires total immunity from error, as we often regard people as knowing things even when minor errors in their reasoning are present.**, **Consider a case where a person knows a true proposition based largely on correct reasoning, with a minor, unrelated error somewhere in their thought process. Intuitively, such an error does not strip their belief of knowledge status.**
