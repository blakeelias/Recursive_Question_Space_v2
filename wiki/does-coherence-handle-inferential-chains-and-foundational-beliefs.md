## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge involves foundational beliefs or sound inferential chains, yet coherence might support systems with no foundations or broken inferential chains.**, **Suppose we have a coherent web of beliefs with no clear foundations or properly concluded inferences. Intuitively, these do not constitute knowledge despite coherence.**
