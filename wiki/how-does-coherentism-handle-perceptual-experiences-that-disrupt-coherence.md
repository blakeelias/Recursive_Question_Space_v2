**Consider a scenario where a person has a clear perceptual experience, like seeing rain, which contradicts their system of beliefs, such as a belief based on an incorrect weather forecast predicting sunshine. Intuitively, seeing the rain leads us to claim the person knows it's raining, despite incoherence with prior beliefs.**, **Immediate perceptual knowledge, despite initial incoherence, suggests that coherence with existing beliefs does not account for all forms of justified true belief.**
