## Content

**Suppose knowing a proposition relies on it being practically successful, but practical success is verified by one's knowledge. Intuitively, we might say that this creates a circular dependence between success and knowledge.**, **It is implausible for a criterion of knowledge to rest on a circular relationship, which results in no independent validation of knowledge itself.**
