## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person gains reliable information through a method they trust, yet they claim to have no belief regarding the proposition communicated by this information. Intuitively, we might judge that they lack belief but still have knowledge.**, **It is plausible that a person can have knowledge of a proposition simply by relying on reliable and accurate testimony, even if they do not actively hold a belief regarding the proposition. This possibility challenges the necessity of belief for knowledge.**
