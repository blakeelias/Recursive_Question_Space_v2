## Content

**Consider a scenario in which one person learns about a historical fact entirely through reliable testimony from a teacher, such as the details of an ancient battle. The learner believes the proposition, and the proposition is true, but the causal link between the historical event and the belief is mediated only by testimony.**, **In cases where information is passed down through reliable chains of testimony rather than direct causal interaction with the fact, it seems problematic to maintain that there is an adequate causal connection in a straightforward sense.**
