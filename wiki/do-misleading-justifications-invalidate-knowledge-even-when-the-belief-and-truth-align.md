**Suppose we have a case where a person sees clouds and believes it will rain, then it rains. However, the clouds were only a result of pollution with no actual relation to rain. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person does not know it will rain or that they do, based on misleading evidence. If we say they know, it challenges the notion that misleading justifications undermine knowledge. If we say they do not, it means justification itself isn't sufficient when misleading.**, **It is implausible that knowledge could result from justifications that are entirely misleading yet align with the truth by sheer accident.**
