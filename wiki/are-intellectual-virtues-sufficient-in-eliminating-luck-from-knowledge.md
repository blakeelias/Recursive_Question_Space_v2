## Content

**A plausible idea is that knowledge should not depend significantly on luck. This idea alongside situations where intellectual virtue leads to true beliefs that fundamentally depend on unpredictable luck—such as guessing the outcome of an election correctly by chance—suggests that virtues might not be enough for knowledge.**, **Consider a scientist using a hypothesis to invent a critical outcome through extensive intellectual work, only to find that an accidental lab spill caused the favorable result. Intuitively, such instances strike us as forms of luck rather than genuine knowledge.**
