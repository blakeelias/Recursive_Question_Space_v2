## Content

**It is possible for someone to act and rely on a proposition consistently without ever consciously acknowledging it as a belief, such as an unreflective practice of a skill. Intuitively, this can still reflect knowledge despite lacking an explicit belief.**, **Suppose a person navigates completely unconsciously through a decision process, yet reliably achieves true outcomes, indicating the presence of knowledge-like state without direct belief articulation.**
