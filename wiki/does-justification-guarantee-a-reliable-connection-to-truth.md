## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person has a justified belief that a proposition is true based on misleading evidence. The belief turns out to be true by chance. Intuitively, we do not consider this to be knowledge.**, **A person sees a friend through a window, which resembles another person's coat. They believe their friend is outside, justified by what they see. It just happens to be true, as their friend is indeed outside, even though seeing the coat was a misleading evidence.**
