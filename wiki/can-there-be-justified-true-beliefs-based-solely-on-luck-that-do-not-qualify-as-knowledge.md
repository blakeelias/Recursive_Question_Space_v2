**Imagine a person whose belief in a distant rainstorm is accidentally informed by the static on a radio signal. By sheer luck, it starts raining. Their belief is true and justified, but intuitively, it's sampled more from luck than knowledge.**, **The role of accidental elements in achieving a justified true belief challenges the sufficiency of the absence of false lemmas for knowledge.**
