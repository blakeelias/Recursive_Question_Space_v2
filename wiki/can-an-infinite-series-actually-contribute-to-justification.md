## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person claims to have an infinite series of reasons, yet none of these reasons are themselves known or understandable. Intuitively, we would have to say that this does not contribute to justification.**, **An infinite series that lacks clarity and understandability seems unable to provide the necessary support for justification.**
