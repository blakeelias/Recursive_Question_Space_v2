## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a scientist uses a finite chain of experimental evidence and theories to know a scientific fact. Intuitively, we judge that the scientist knows the fact despite not having an infinite chain of reasons.**, **For many everyday and scientific propositions, comprehensive finite reasons grant us a confident interpretation of knowledge, indicating skepticism towards infinitism.**
