## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a person forms a belief using intellectually virtuous reasoning processes, but luck intervenes to make the belief true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the person knows the proposition or that their knowledge is due to luck, which complicates the role of intellectual virtue.**, **A case in which a person forms a belief through an exercise of intellectual virtue but external luck makes the belief true challenges the sufficiency of intellectual virtue for knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must not only be true, but true due to the person's cognitive ability or virtue, without reliance on cognitive luck.**
