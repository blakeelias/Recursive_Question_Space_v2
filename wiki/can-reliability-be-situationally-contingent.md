**Suppose a person has a cognitive process that is highly reliable in one environment but unreliable in another. They use this process to form a belief in an unfamiliar environment where the process is unreliable, and this belief turns out to be true by coincidence. Intuitively, we would not credit them with knowledge in this scenario.**
