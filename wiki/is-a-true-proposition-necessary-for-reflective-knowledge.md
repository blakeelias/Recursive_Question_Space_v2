**Imagine a scenario where someone has an impeccable reasoning process that leads them to a false conclusion due to misinformation. Intuitively, they seem to have reflective knowledge due to perfect reflective processes, even though the proposition is false.**, **The principle that truth must underpin reflective knowledge appears more of a result-focused condition, which is unnecessary if the process is perfectly reflective.**, **A philosophical principle asserts that reflective knowledge might be more about the rational process than the truth of the proposition.**
