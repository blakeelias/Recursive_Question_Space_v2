**Suppose a person uses highly sophisticated methods to arrive at a belief, but, due to a rare external factor, the belief turns out false.**, **In this case, the personâ€™s method is adroit, indicating skillful application of ability, even though the belief is neither accurate nor apt.**, **The fact that matter perfectly methodical processes can still lead to untrue conclusions suggests that adroit does not guarantee aptitude or accuracy.**
