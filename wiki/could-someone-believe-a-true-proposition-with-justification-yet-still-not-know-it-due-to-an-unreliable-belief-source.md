**Consider a scenario where someone believes they will win a lottery because a psychic told them so, and by sheer luck, they win. Intuitively, we would judge that they do not know they will win despite having a justified true belief.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge requires beliefs to be formed through reliable methods rather than sheer coincidence. This principle implies that justified true belief without reliability does not suffice for knowledge.**
