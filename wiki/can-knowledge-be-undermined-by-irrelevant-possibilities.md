## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person visits a zoo and sees an animal that looks like a zebra, is labeled as a zebra, and is in the zebra pen. Intuitively, the person believes it is a zebra.**, **Suppose in this scenario that the zoo has just installed a convincing zebra-lookalike robot in the zooâ€™s lion pen to entertain visitors. Intuitively, the person would still believe it is a zebra even if it were false.**, **The person cannot know it is a zebra if there exists a plausible case where, if the proposition about it being a real zebra were false, the person would still hold the same belief.**
