**Consider a scenario where a person forms a true belief about the weather based on an unreliable weather app that happens to be correct by chance. Intuitively, we would judge that this belief is not apt despite being true and accurate.**, **An apt belief is one that achieves truth because of the person's adroitness, or skill.
