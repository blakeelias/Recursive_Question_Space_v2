**Consider a scenario where a person has a justified true belief due to a double-luck situation, like the classic Gettier cases. We would judge that having justified true belief in such scenarios does not amount to knowledge.**, **There is a widely accepted principle that knowledge should exclude luck. Gettier cases show that even with justified true belief, the condition of excluding luck is violated, thus showing justified true belief as insufficient for knowledge.**
