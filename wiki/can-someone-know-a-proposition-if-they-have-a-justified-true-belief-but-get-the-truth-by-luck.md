**Consider a scenario where a person sees a clock stopped at 2:00, believes it is 2:00, and it is indeed 2:00 by coincidence. Intuitively, we would judge that the person does not know it is 2:00 despite having a justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge should not be based on accidental or coincidental truths. This principle together with the situation described entails that possessing justified true belief is not always sufficient for knowledge.**
