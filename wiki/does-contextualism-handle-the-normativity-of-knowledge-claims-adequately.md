**Knowledge claims are often normative, meaning they come with expectations of action based on that knowledge.**, **If standards for justification can vary with context, it might lead to confusion regarding which actions are justified under differing knowledge claims.**, **Such variability could result in conflicting indications about what ought to be done, thereby undermining the normative role of knowledge.**
