## Content

**Consider a scenario involving an artificial intelligence that consistently produces true beliefs without exercising what we would consider intellectual virtues. In such a scenario, intuitively we might still attribute knowledge to the AI despite the absence of intellectual virtues.**, **It is implausible that intellectual virtues are necessary for every instance of knowledge, as some non-human systems might possess knowledge absent of such virtues.**, **There is a plausible principle that entities can possess knowledge through mechanisms that do not involve traditional intellectual virtues, suggesting the necessity of those virtues is overstated.**
