**Consider a scenario in which a person believes that they are drinking from a bottle labeled 'Water,' they have justification in noticing the label, and it is true that they are indeed drinking water. However, intuitively, they do not know they are drinking water if the label could have easily been switched without their knowledge.**, **Consider a situation where a person finds a stoplight appearing red, they believe it is red, they have justification from observing it, and it is true the light is red. Intuitively, they would not know the light is red if the stoplight is faulty and shows red incorrectly half the time.**
