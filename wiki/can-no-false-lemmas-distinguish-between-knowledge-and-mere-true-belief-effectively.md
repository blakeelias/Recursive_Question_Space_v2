**A person can have a true belief that is not based on any false lemmas, yet intuitively, this true belief does not always seem to qualify as knowledge.**, **The distinction between knowledge and true belief often involves an added factor such as reliability or understanding, which 'No False Lemmas' fails to capture alone.**, **If 'No False Lemmas' cannot effectively delineate knowledge from true belief, it does not adequately explain what constitutes knowledge.**
