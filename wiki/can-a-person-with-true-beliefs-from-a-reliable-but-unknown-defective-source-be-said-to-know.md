## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a proposition that is true and formed through a reliable process, but the person has compelling but false reasons to believe the process is unreliable.**, **Intuitively, we would suggest that the person lacks knowledge, since they have good reason to doubt the reliability of their belief-forming process.**
