## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a person believes a true proposition with ample evidence but is unaware of a defeater due to lack of access to certain information. Intuitively, the person seems to possess knowledge, even though their justification could be undermined if new facts were revealed.**, **It is implausible that knowledge should be contingent on awareness of all potential defeaters, as this would make knowledge too demanding and practically unattainable.**
