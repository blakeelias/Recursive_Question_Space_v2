**Suppose a person, Sara, is reading a reputable newspaper that reports that a certain celebrity is vacationing in Spain. From this, Sara believes the celebrity is in Spain, giving her a justified true belief. However, the newspaper also publishes about the same celebrity vacationing in Italy in a similarly reputable section, which she reads later and then believes. Intuitively, despite having a justified true belief multiple times, Sara's shifting beliefs suggest she does not know where the celebrity is.**
