## Content

**Failing to analyze knowledge into more basic components might limit epistemic inquiry and prevent deeper understanding of cognitive states.**, **Analysis often leads to refinement and a clearer understanding of a concept's role within a theoretical framework. Intuitively, analyzing knowledge might uncover structures or principles that improve epistemic methods, similar to how science progresses by analyzing phenomena.**
