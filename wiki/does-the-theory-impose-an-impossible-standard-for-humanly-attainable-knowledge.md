**In realistic scenarios, a belief supported by evidence could potentially have defeaters that are beyond the believer's capacity to identify or recognize.**, **The standard requiring no true defeaters could render most empirical knowledge unattainable, given the practical limits of human investigation and understanding.**, **It is implausible to assume that we have access to all possible defeaters, challenging the applicability of the no-defeater condition for knowledge.**
