## Content

**Suppose someone in a lottery consistently guesses winning numbers for reasons unrelated to any statistical or logical strategy; they are successful but not because they know the outcome. Intuitively, their success is luck-based rather than knowledge-based, challenging the connection between practical success and knowledge.**, **Intuitively, luck can lead to practical success without constituting knowledge, indicating that practical utility or success are not sufficient for knowledge.**
