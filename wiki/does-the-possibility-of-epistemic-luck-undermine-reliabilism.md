**Imagine a person forms a true belief about a friendâ€™s whereabouts through a normally reliable process of asking them, but purely by luck, that day their friend lied and ended up at the place mentioned. Intuitively, this undermines the claim to knowledge since luck, not reliability, led to truth that day.**, **Reliability under actual epistemic circumstances might exclude knowledge derived inadvertently through lucky correct guesses or deception scenarios, aligning with intuitive knowledge understanding.**
