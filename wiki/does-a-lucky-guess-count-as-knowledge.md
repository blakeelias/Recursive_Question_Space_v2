## Content

**Consider a student who believes that a certain historical event occurred in 1607 due to an arbitrary guess.**, **When asked, the student guesses correctly and believes her guess is true, but her internal justification, being random, doesn't confer genuine knowledge. Intuitively, knowledge requires more than true belief supported by chance.**
