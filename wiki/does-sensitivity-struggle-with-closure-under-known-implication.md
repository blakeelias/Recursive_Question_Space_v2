## Content

**There is a plausible principle that if a person knows one proposition and knows that it entails a second proposition, then the person knows the second proposition.**, **Consider a case in which a person knows they have hands. A plausible deduction is that if they have hands, they are not merely a brain in a vat.**, **In this case, Sensitivity Theory might suggest they know they have hands, but do not believe they would reject the belief they are not a brain in a vat if it were false, undermining closure under known implication.**
