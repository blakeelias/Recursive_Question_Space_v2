## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a surgeon operates based on a coherent belief system acquired through training and practice, yet an unexpected anatomical variation makes those beliefs false in this context. Intuitively, we might judge their knowledge claim inapplicable without modifying beliefs.**, **There is a plausible principle that practical contexts introduce variables where belief systems meeting coherence standards may fail if they incorporate false context-specific details.**, **It is implausible that ignoring the influence of practical contexts maintains an unchallenged knowledge claim based solely on coherence criteria.**
