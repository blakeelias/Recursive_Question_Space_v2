## Content

**It is implausible to maintain a universal set of defeaters, as what counts as a defeater can vary greatly between different contexts and individual perspectives.**, **Consider a situation where cultural differences lead to divergent judgments about what constitutes a defeater for a belief. Intuitively, the notion of true defeaters is too subjective and fluid to be a rigid requirement for knowledge.**
