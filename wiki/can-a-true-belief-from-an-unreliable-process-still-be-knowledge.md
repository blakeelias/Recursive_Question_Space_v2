**Consider a scenario in which a person comes to believe a true proposition through a process known to be highly unreliable, such as guessing. Intuitively, we might judge that the person does not genuinely know the proposition despite the truth of the belief and the presence of belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that a belief is not sufficient for knowledge if it is primarily based on an unreliable method, even if the belief happens to be true. This principle challenges the idea that reliability is the sole or most important consideration in defining knowledge.**
