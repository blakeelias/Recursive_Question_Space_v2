## Content

**Consider a scenario in which two people are in different contexts, one with high standards and another with low standards for justification. Person A, in the high-standard context, cannot claim to know that "the bank is open" due to requiring more evidence. Intuitively, this suggests Person A lacks knowledge.**, **Meanwhile, Person B, in a low-standard context, claims to know "the bank is open" with less rigorous evidence. Intuitively, this indicates Person B has knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that if Person A and Person B consider the same proposition, then if one knows it, so should the other. This principle entails a contradiction in knowledge claims between Person A and Person B.**
