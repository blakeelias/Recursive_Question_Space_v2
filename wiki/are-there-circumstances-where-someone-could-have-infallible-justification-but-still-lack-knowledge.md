**Consider a hypothetical where technology grants a person perfect probability calculations about future events, yet a highly improbable true event disrupts these calculations, nullifying the outcome. Here, the person has justified true belief about the predicted outcome, lacking actual knowledge due to unforeseen true intervention.**, **For a definition of knowledge to be sufficient, it should account for anomalies where extreme improbability affects the reliability of otherwise justified true beliefs.**
