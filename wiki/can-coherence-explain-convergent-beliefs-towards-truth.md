## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge systems should converge on truth over time. However, a coherent set of beliefs might remain isolated and non-convergent towards truth.**, **Suppose an isolated society holds a coherent yet unique belief system that does not integrate or align with other societies progressing towards scientific truths. Intuitively, this coherence doesnâ€™t signify knowledge.**
