## Content

**Consider a scenario where a person believes a true proposition based on faulty reasoning or a lucky guess. Intuitively, we judge that this person does not actually know the proposition, as knowledge requires more than just true belief arrived at by accident.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires a reliable method of arriving at truth. This principle suggests that merely having a justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge if the justification is flawed.**
