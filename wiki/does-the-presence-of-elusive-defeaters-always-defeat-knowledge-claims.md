## Content

**Suppose a person believes a true proposition with strong justification, but there exists a true piece of evidence they are unaware of that would oppose their justification. Intuitively, the person might still be said to know the proposition since they never encounter the defeater.**, **A defeater that never comes into play and remains unknown to the person does not necessarily undermine the knowledge claim.**
