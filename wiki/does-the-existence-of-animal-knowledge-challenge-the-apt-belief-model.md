**Consider a bird that 'knows' where to find food through instinctual behavior rather than skillful reasoning. Intuitively, we often credit animals with knowledge without implying they possess adroitness in their belief-forming processes.**, **If such cases count as knowledge, then aptness, which implies a level of reflective skill or human-like reason, may not adequately capture all occurrences of genuine knowledge.**
