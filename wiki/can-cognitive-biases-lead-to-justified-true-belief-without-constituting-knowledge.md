**Consider a gambler, Eli, who believes his lucky streak will continue purely based on an irrational cognitive bias, which is unjustified by probability and statistics. Suppose he wins again, making his belief true and appears justified in hindsight. Intuitively, Eli does not know he will win, despite his belief fitting the justified true belief framework.**, **This demonstrates that cognitive biases can generate scenarios where a belief meets the conditions of being justified and true but still fails to be knowledge, challenging its sufficiency.**
