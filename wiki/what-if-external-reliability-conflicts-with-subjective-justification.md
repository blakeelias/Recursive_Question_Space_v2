## Content

**There is a plausible principle that subjective justification—where one can provide reasons or evidence for their belief—is a critical component of knowledge. This principle together with the notion of external reliability being sufficient for knowledge implies that someone can know something without having any personal reasons or explanations for their belief.**, **In a case where an individual forms a belief based on a generally reliable mechanism, like a malfunctioning thermometer, they may not have justification even if the thermometer is accidentally correct. It seems implausible to claim they have knowledge without personal justification.**
