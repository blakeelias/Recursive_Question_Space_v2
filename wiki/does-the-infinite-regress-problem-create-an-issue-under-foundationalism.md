**Foundationalism aims to stop an infinite regress of justifications by positing foundational beliefs that do not require further justification.**, **A potential objection to foundationalism is the question of how foundational beliefs themselves are justified if they are meant to halt the regress without leading to arbitrariness or dogmatism.**, **Intuitively, if foundational beliefs lack further justification, then those beliefs could seem arbitrary.**
