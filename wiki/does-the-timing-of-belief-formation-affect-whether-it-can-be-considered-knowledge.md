**Suppose a person forms a belief based on outdated evidence, like believing their friend is in town based on a schedule from weeks ago. Unknown to them, their friend happened to return unexpectedly. Their belief is true and justified, but the time gap intuitively affects our judgment on whether they have knowledge.**, **The recency and relevance of the justification may impact the attribution of knowledge even if false lemmas are absent, suggesting further conditions are necessary for knowledge.**
