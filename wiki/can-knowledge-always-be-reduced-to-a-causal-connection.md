## Content

**There is a plausible principle that knowledge requires more than just believing a true proposition. This principle suggests that mere causality may not capture all the necessary conditions for knowledge.**, **In certain cases, intuitively we would judge that a person knows something without being aware of the specific causal connection to the truth of the proposition.**, **Consider a scenario in which a person forms a belief based on reliable evidence, but the causal path to the fact is indirect or unknown to them. Intuitively, we still attribute knowledge to them.**
