## Content

**Suppose someone forms a belief based on a long chain of reasoning, where some intermediary steps are forgotten but not all are false. The belief is true, and the initial justification was based on true premises. Intuitively, the person retains knowledge because the underlying process was initially sound even if not all steps are remembered.**, **The necessity of explicit justification for each step in a chain may not be practical or reasonable, implying that knowledge can persist despite incomplete recall of its justification.**
