**Imagine someone who believes a bird they see is a hawk, based on a wildlife guide, and the belief is true because it is indeed a hawk. However, if the person is in an area where rules about hawks differ significantly from their guide, intuitively, this does not count as knowledge.**, **Consider an individual at an airport determining terminal departure based on signs, where their belief is true and justified. However, if signage is occasionally misleading or frequently changes, it intuitively fails the criteria for knowledge.**
