## Content

**There is an intuition that knowledge claims should not be overly complex or variable simply due to changes in conversational context.**, **Contextualism makes knowledge claims heavily dependent on subtle contextual shifts, which seems to contravene the intuition of knowledge simplicity.**, **A case where similar evidence leads to different knowledge judgments due to context shift feels unintuitive and overly complex.**
