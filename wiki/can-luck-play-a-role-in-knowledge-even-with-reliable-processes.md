**Consider a scenario where a reliable process correctly leads to a true belief, but only because of an element of luck, such as a radar detecting an aircraft accurately despite interference that normally would cause errors. In such a scenario, intuitively we would question whether this counts as genuine knowledge due to its dependence on luck.**, **The role of luck in obtaining true beliefs produced by reliable processes shows that reliability alone might not suffice for knowledge.**
