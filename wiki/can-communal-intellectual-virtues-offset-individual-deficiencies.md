## Content

**Consider a situation where an individual, due to personal limitations, constantly seeks and integrates insights from a diverse community, such as a research team converging on a solution. Intuitively, their collective results may afford them knowledge even if, individually, they lack the virtues to arrive at it on their own.**, **There is a plausible principle that social epistemic environments can enhance what collectively counts as knowledge beyond individual virtue performance.**
