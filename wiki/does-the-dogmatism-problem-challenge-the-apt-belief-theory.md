**Suppose we have a case in which an individual is unjustifiably confident about their belief's truth but happens to be right due to their own skill. Intuitively, either this confidence wrongly legitimizes the belief as knowledge, or apt belief overlooks factors needed to constitute knowledge.**, **It is implausible that confidence and skill alone are adequate criteria for true belief being characterized as knowledge.**
