**Suppose person B sees a broken clock showing the correct time at the moment they look at it. B believes it is that time, with justification based on seeing the clock display, and it is true. Intuitively, we would say B lacks knowledge due to the misleading evidence, despite holding a justified true belief.**, **Instances where evidence is misleading lead to justified true beliefs that we would not consider knowledge.**
