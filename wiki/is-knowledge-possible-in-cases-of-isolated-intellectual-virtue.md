## Content

**It is implausible that simply exercising intellectual virtue in isolation could guarantee knowledge without support from additional factors, such as cross-verification or environmental support.**, **Consider a thinker living in a world with deceptive environments where they consistently use intellectual virtues yet their beliefs fail to align with truth due to constant environmental misdirection. Intuitively, such a scenario seems to rule out the person's beliefs counting as knowledge, despite their virtues.**
