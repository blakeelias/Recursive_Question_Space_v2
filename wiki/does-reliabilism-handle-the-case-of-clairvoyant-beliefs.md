**Suppose a person forms a belief through what appears to be an unreliable means like clairvoyance, yet this process consistently yields true beliefs. Intuitively, whether the person has knowledge is questionable, even if the process could be seen as reliable.**, **Reliabilism implies that the consistent truth of beliefs formed through such processes would amount to knowledge despite common intuitions to the contrary.**
