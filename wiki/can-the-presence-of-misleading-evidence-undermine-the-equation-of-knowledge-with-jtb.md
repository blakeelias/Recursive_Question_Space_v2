**Consider a scenario in which a person has justified true belief about a proposition, but is also exposed to misleading evidence suggesting the opposite. Intuitively, the presence of misleading evidence affects the stability and thus undermines the concept of knowledge.**, **A plausible condition for knowledge involves not just justification and truth, but a robustness against misleading evidence, which the justified true belief model might inadequately capture.**
