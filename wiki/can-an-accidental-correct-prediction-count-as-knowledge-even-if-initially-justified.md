**Consider a scenario where a gambler bets on a team winning a match based on reliable analysis but the team wins due to the opponent's accidental errors. Intuitively, we would judge that the gambler does not have knowledge of the win despite having a justified true belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that predictions turning true due to accidental factors undermine the sufficiency of justified true belief for knowledge.**
