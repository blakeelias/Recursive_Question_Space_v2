## Content

**Suppose a person has a justified true belief about a proposition because they witnessed it. Later, they forget the witnessing and retain the belief purely with no causal memory connection. Although the proposition is true and they believe it, there is no longer an appropriate causal connection.**, **In such a scenario where the causal memory link is severed, it is implausible to say the person still knows the proposition, showcasing a possible failure of the causal theory to account for knowledge retention.**
