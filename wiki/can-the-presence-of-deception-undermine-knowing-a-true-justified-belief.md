**Consider a case in which a student believes they passed a test because a teacher jokingly assured them they did well, when in fact they did pass but for unrelated reasons. Intuitively, we would judge that the student does not truly know they passed despite holding a justified true belief.**, **A plausible principle is that knowledge cannot be founded on deceptive justifications even if the belief is true.
