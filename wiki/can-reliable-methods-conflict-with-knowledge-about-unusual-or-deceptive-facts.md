**Consider a scenario where someone uses a reliable scientific method to test for a normally nonexistent phenomenon, like telepathy, and the test gives a false-positive result. Intuitively, they do not know telepathy exists, challenging how reliability accommodates unusual facts.**, **Reliable processes normally rely on common assumptions, hence when these assumptions falsify, reliability may not suffice for knowledge, especially against deceptive or unlikely scenarios.**
