**For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition**, **for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true**, **for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there is an appropriate causal connection between the belief and the fact**, **for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and there is an appropriate causal connection**
