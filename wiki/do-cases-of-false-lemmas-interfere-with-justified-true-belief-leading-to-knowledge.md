**Consider a case where Tim believes that Jones owns a Ferrari based on his own observations and reliable testimonies. From this, Tim concludes that someone in his office owns a Ferrari, which is true because another coworker, Smith, actually owns one too. However, Tim is unaware of Smith's Ferrari. Intuitively, Tim does not know someone in his office owns a Ferrari, despite having a justified true belief.**, **This indicates that having a justified true belief is not always sufficient for knowledge if the belief stems from a false premise or lemma, challenging the traditional view on knowledge.**
