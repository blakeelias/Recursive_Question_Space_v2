## Content

**Suppose we have a case where a false lemma does not affect the core justification for a belief. Intuitively, the belief should still qualify as knowledge.**, **For example, a detective solves a case with a false assumption but deduces the correct perpetrator with precision; it might seem plausible to claim knowledge.**
