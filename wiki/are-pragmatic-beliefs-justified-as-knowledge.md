## Content

**Suppose we recognize a belief as effective for guiding action but hold doubts about its truth from a rational perspective. Intuitively, practical justification does not entail epistemic justification.**, **For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief proves to be practically useful or successful.**, **It is implausible that practical utility alone provides epistemic justification for belief.**
