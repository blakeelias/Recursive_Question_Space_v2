## Content

**Consider a scenario in which a person acts consistently and predictively in alignment with a true proposition without explicitly believing or forming a conscious belief about it, such as a deeply ingrained habit. Intuitively, it might seem that the person still knows the proposition in a practical sense.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowledge does not require active belief, but rather the capacity to successfully navigate the world, which might involve forms of "knowing-how" or implicit knowledge.**
