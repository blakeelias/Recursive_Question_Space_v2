## Content

**Consider a situation where a person believes a proposition based on available evidence, and later receives additional evidence that weakens the strength of their belief without introducing a true defeater. Intuitively, this change in beliefâ€™s strength suggests it may not have been known before the new evidence was received.**, **Weakening evidence, even in absence of true defeaters, should inform whether original knowledge claims were valid, challenging the necessity of true defeaters in affecting knowledge.**
