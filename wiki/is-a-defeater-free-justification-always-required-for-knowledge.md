## Content

**Consider a case where a person has a justified true belief about a proposition, but their justification relies on evidence that is later discovered to be misleading, though their belief remains true.**, **Intuitively, it seems counterintuitive to regard the person's belief as knowledge if their justification process, based on misleading evidence, is affected by a defeater, casting doubt on the requirement for a defeater-free justification.**
