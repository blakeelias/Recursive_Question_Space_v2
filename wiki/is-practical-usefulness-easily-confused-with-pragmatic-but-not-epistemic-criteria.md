## Content

**Consider an instance where practical usefulness is mistaken for pragmatics instead of epistemology, such as believing a comforting lie. Intuitively, we might judge that what is pragmatically useful isn't epistemically justifiable as knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that epistemic criteria should be distinct from pragmatic considerations, challenging the notion that practical success relates to epistemic justification.**
