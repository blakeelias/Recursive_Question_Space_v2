**Imagine two individuals forming belief about the price of a stock; one guesses correctly without evidence while the other analyzes financial reports, arriving at the same prediction. Both beliefs are true and justified, yet intuitively, only the analyzed case seems to result in knowledge.**, **Instances where superficial indistinguishability in belief formation yield drastically different epistemic outcomes pose challenges to justified true belief accounting as knowledge.**
