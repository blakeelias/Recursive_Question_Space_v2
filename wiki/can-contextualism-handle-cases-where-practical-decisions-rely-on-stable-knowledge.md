## Content

**Imagine a situation where someone must make an important practical decision, like investing money or deciding on medical treatment, based on what they "know." If standards of justification fluctuate with context, the grounding of their decision becomes unstable, potentially leading to irrational choices. Intuitively, practical decision-making should depend on stable epistemic grounds, not variable contexts.**, **There is a plausible requirement that practical decisions be informed by consistent knowledge. This demand for stability is threatened if contextualism permits justification to vary independently of practical needs.**
