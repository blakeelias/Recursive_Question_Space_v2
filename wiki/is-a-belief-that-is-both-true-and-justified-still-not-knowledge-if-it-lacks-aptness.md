## Content

**If a belief is true and justified by evidence but lacks the characteristic of being apt, we might intuitively still categorize it as knowledge despite lacking one condition.**, **A true and justified belief might fail to be apt simply because of an atypical connection between the evidence and truth, but this peculiar disconnection might not intuitively strip a belief of its knowledge status.**, **There can be a scenario where a belief is true and well supported by justification, yet fails to qualify as knowledge solely due to lack of aptness, which may not always intuitively disqualify it from being knowledge.**
