## Content

**Suppose we have a case in which a belief is formed through a reliable unconscious process, such as an intuition arising from subliminal exposure that turns out to be true. Intuitively, we either have to say that the unconscious reliable process results in the person knowing the proposition or not knowing it. If we say it results in knowledge, this implies that conscious awareness of cognitive processes is not necessary for knowledge. If we say it does not result in knowledge, then reliability alone does not suffice.**, **The lack of accessibility or awareness of reliably formed beliefs contributes to questioning whether all such beliefs constitute knowledge.**
