## Content

**Consider a case where a person justifies their belief in a true proposition using unreliable evidence, yet encounters no defeaters. Despite meeting defeasibility conditions, intuitively, this undermines their knowledge claim.**, **A plausible principle suggests that the reliability of the evidence itself is critical to determining knowledge, challenging the sufficiency of the lack of defeaters.**
