## Content

**Many epistemological models suggest that some basic beliefs require no further justification beyond their foundations. If these basic beliefs are possible, then infinite chains are not required for knowledge.**, **For example, a person's knowledge of a self-evident truth or direct experience does not necessitate an infinite justification, as the foundational belief suffices.**
