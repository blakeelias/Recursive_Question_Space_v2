## Content

**A principled distinction between knowledge-conducive and non-conducive causal links may be required, which the theory might not provide.**, **Imagine a case where an individual's true belief leads coincidentally from unreliable sources. Intuitively, this lacks the epistemic merit attributed to knowledge.**, **There is a plausible principle that not all causal links that lead to true belief can be equated to genuine knowledge.**
