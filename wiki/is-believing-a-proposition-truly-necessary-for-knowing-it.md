**Consider a scenario in which a person comes to know something through unconscious awareness without forming a conscious belief, such as recognizing an emotional signal through body language without realizing it. In such a scenario, intuitively we may judge that the person knows the signal's meaning without holding a conscious propositional belief.**, **There is a plausible principle that knowing does not always require conscious belief, supported by cases where individuals act correctly based on information they cannot explicitly state.**
