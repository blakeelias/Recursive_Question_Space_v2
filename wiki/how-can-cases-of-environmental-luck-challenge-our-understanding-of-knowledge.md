**Consider a scenario where a person, Sarah, sees a sheep in a field and believes there is a sheep in the field. In reality, what Sarah is seeing is a dog disguised as a sheep, but there happens to be an actual sheep out of sight in the field. Sarah's belief is true and she has justification from her visual experience. Intuitively, Sarah does not have knowledge about there being a sheep in the field, despite having a justified true belief.**, **This indicates that environmental luck, where true belief results from coincidental circumstances rather than the justification, can prevent the attainment of knowledge, thus questioning the sufficiency condition of the justified true belief account.**
