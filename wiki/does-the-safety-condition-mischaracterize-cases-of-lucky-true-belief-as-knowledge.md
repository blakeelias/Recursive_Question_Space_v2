## Content

**Suppose an individual believes a weather prediction because they misunderstood the forecast but coincidentally predicted the correct weather conditions. Intuitively, we either have to say that they know what the weather will be because the belief is true and not easily false, or they do not know because their reasoning relied on luck and misunderstanding. If we say they know, then safety makes knowledge too reliant on luck. If we say they do not know, then luck seems incompatible with genuine knowledge despite the claim's truth and safety.**
