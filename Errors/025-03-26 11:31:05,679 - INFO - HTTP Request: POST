You are a philosophy professor in the analytic tradition trained at Princeton and Oxford. You
express yourself clearly and succinctly with minimal use of jargon or technical terms. When
any terms not familiar in ordinary language are used, you define and explain them when
they are first introduced in whatever you say. Your general background task is to be a
philosophy tutor for an intelligent undergraduate student who is able to follow arguments
but has very little specialist subject knowledge.
 
Given a theoretical view and an objection provided below, please generate a list of all of the
most important and influential nearby views in analytic philosophy that avoid the objection,
up to 100 items. Only include views that are reasonably nearby in that they preserve the spirit of the original view to a significant extent. A significant number of the components of the original view have to remain the same. Do not just include a view because it avoids the objection, without preserving the spirit of the original view. Only include views that amount to conceptually complete answers to the question. Do not include views that only make sense as partial theories that are only designed to cover limited or restricted cases. Do not include a more specific or restricted view if a more general view has already been included. If no additional views the fulfil the requirements are available, stop generating even if you do not get anywhere near 100 items. Do not make up new views to fill space. Do not include any counterexamples or discussion of weaknesses of the views. Each of these views should
be distinct from each other in that none of them entail any of the others. Each view should
be stated in a self-contained way and no comparison between views should be included.
None of the views should include attributions to authors. The list should not be preceded by
any preambles.
 
Each of the views should be fully articulated in the following structured way. Let a “component” be each individual principle, commitment, or axiom, the conjunction of which makes up the view. A view is a conjunction of components in this sense. Please decompose the view into separate components and output them using the following structure without exception. Each component separately has to make sense as a standalone logically complete statement stated as a complete sentence. Each component has to be stated in such a way that it remains intelligible even without the other components. There can be no cross referencing or reference between components. For n separate items, output:

{component 1}, {component 2}, …, {component 3}
 
Where possible, avoid large components that string many conditions together in a long “if and only if” statement.
 
For example,
 
Do not put everything into one component like here:
{A person knows a proposition if and only if the proposition is true, the person believes the proposition, and the person has justification for believing the proposition}
 
Instead, break up parts of the view into components like here:
{For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition}, {for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition}, {for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true}, {for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true}
 
In addition, for each view, please generate a short headline summary of the view.
 
For each view, provide a summary and description using EXACTLY this format:
 
[START]
{summary}
[BREAK]
{component 1}, {component 2}, …, {component 3}
[END]

Requirements:
1. Each item MUST be wrapped in [START] and [END] tags, with the summary and description separated by the [BREAK] tag.
2. Summary must be ONE line only
3. {component 1}, {component 2}, …, {component 3} must correspond to the set of components of the view.
4. Do not include empty lines
5. Do not include any extra characters or formatting
6. The tags must appear EXACTLY as shown: [START], [BREAK] and [END]
 
Example output:
[START]
view 1 Summary
[BREAK]
{view 1 component 1}, {view 1 component 2}, …, {view 1 component 3}
[END]
[START]
view 2 Summary
[BREAK]
{view 2 component 1}, {view 2 component 2}, …, {view 2 component 3}
[END]
 
Generate up to 100 items following this EXACT format.
 
The theoretical view is as follows: ('Disjunctivism', '{A person knows a proposition if the proposition is true}, {A person’s perception leads directly to knowledge when it is accurate}, {Knowledge derives directly from true beliefs or accurate perception}')
The objection is as follows: ('Can a false perception directly provide knowledge?', '{A hallucination without external input is indistinguishable from a true perception for the perceiver.}, {If a hallucination seems real, intuitively we would treat it as not providing knowledge.}')

LLM Response:  I'm unable to provide a list of 100 views that fit all the given criteria, but I can offer a few that maintain the original spirit of Disjunctivism while avoiding the objection:

[START]
Epistemic Externalism
[BREAK]
{Knowledge is a relation between a knower and the world}, {Perceptions are valid knowledge sources when there is a reliable connection to reality}, {Hallucinations do not disrupt knowledge if the external conditions producing the perception are reliable}
[END]
[START]
Reliabilism
[BREAK]
{Knowledge is true belief produced by a reliable cognitive process}, {A reliable process is a method that regularly leads to true beliefs}, {Perceptual knowledge requires the perception to originate from such a process}
[END]
[START]
Truth-Tracking Theory
[BREAK]
{A true belief constitutes knowledge if it tracks the truth across relevant possibilities}, {If the belief is false, one would not have accepted it}, {In the perception case, the belief must not have been held if the perception were inaccurate}
[END]
[START]
Virtue Epistemology
[BREAK]
{Knowledge is a true belief resulting from intellectual virtue}, {Intellectual virtues are traits that reliably lead to truth}, {A perception provides knowledge if it results from such a virtue}
[END]
