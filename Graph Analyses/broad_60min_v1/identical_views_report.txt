Summary: Knowledge is a true belief underpinned by evidential support.
Content: In this view, knowledge is characterized as a true belief that is firmly backed by significant evidence or reasons. Justification must derive from evidence that can reliably establish the truth of the belief, and this evidential support plays a critical role in defining knowledge. By necessitating a strong evidential underpinning, this approach seeks to preclude the sorts of cases presented in the Gettier problem, where mere justified true beliefs occur without adequate support.
