Traditional Justified True Belief Theory:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Gettier's Challenge to Justified True Belief:
- A person can have a justified true belief without it being knowledge
- A person can have a belief that is justified and true by luck, not knowledge
- Knowledge requires more than justified true belief
- There can be cases where a person's justified true belief is based on false premises

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief is produced by a reliable process
- A reliable process is one that generally produces true beliefs
- Justification is not necessary for knowledge
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition and their belief is produced by a reliable process

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief is not based on any false assumptions
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, their belief is not based on any false assumptions, and the proposition is true

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the fact that makes the proposition true causes the person to believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the fact that makes the proposition true causes the person to believe the proposition, and the proposition is true

Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is useful for the person in their practical affairs
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is useful for the person in their practical affairs, and the proposition is true

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs, and the proposition is true

Contextualist Theory of Knowledge:
- The standards for knowing a proposition can vary depending on the context
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they meet the standards for knowing in their current context
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they meet the standards for knowing in their current context and the proposition is true
