JTB Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Gettier Problem:
- In some instances, justified true belief does not constitute knowledge
- Counterexamples exist where a person has justified true belief but is led to this belief through faulty reasoning or luck
- These counterexamples demonstrate that an additional condition is necessary for knowledge beyond justified true belief

Reliabilism:
- Knowledge is a belief that is both true and formed by a reliable process
- A reliable process is one that generally produces true beliefs
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that the proposition is true and that the person's belief in the proposition was formed through a reliable process

Evidentialism:
- Knowledge requires that one's belief is justified by evidence
- The evidence must be accessible to the person whose belief it is
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have evidence for the proposition

Virtue Epistemology:
- Knowledge is a true belief that results from virtuous intellectual activity
- A virtuous intellectual activity is one that is characteristic of a good cognitive agent
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and their belief results from virtuous intellectual activity

Internalism:
- The factors that warrant a belief and turn it into knowledge must be internal to the person
- These factors can include personal experiences, thoughts, feelings, or memories
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have internally accessible warrant for the proposition

Externalism:
- The factors that warrant a belief and turn it into knowledge can be external to the person
- These factors can include the reliability of the cognitive process used to form the belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that the proposition is true and that the person's belief in the proposition was formed through a reliable process

Contextualism:
- The standards for knowledge vary depending on the context
- In some contexts, more stringent standards are required for knowledge
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they meet the standards for knowledge in the relevant context

Infinitism:
- Justification for a belief requires an infinite chain of reasons
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have an infinite chain of reasons supporting the belief
- This chain of reasons can neither be circular nor end in an unjustified belief
