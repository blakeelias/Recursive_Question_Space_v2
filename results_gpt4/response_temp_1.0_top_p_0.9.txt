Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition

- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, there are no true defeaters for the belief and the proposition is true

Bayesian Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief's probability is confirmed by the evidence
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief's probability is confirmed by the evidence and the proposition is true
