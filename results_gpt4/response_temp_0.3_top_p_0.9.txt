Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge is a type of belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge is a type of belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the belief to be produced by a reliable process
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is produced by a reliable process, and the proposition is true

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge is a type of belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification does not depend on any false propositions
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and the justification does not depend on any false propositions

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge is a type of belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the belief to be caused by the truth of the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is caused by the truth of the proposition, and the proposition is true

Defeasibility Theory of Knowledge:

- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there are no true defeaters of the justification
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and there are no true defeaters of the justification

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge is a type of belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the belief to cohere with the rest of their beliefs
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs, and the proposition is true
