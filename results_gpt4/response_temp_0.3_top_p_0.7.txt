Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilism about Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition is produced by a reliable cognitive process
- A cognitive process is reliable if and only if it tends to produce true beliefs and avoid false ones

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person's belief in the proposition is not based on any false assumptions
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition is caused by the fact that makes the proposition true
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Defeasibility Theory of Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition is justified and there are no defeating conditions
- A defeating condition is a condition that, if it were to obtain, would undermine the justification for the belief
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition coheres with the rest of their beliefs
- Coherence involves logical consistency, explanatory relations, and various probabilistic relations among beliefs
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Virtue Epistemology:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition is the result of a virtuous intellectual act
- An intellectual virtue is a character trait that promotes the acquisition, maintenance, and use of knowledge
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Contextualist Theory of Knowledge:
- Whether a person knows a proposition depends on the context in which the claim to know is made
- In some contexts, higher standards of evidence are required for knowledge than in others
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the belief in the proposition leads to successful action
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true

Infinitism about Knowledge:
- A person knows a proposition if and only if the person's belief in the proposition is supported by an infinite chain of reasons
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the person believes the proposition
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the proposition is true
