Classical Foundationalism:
- Knowledge is based on foundational beliefs that are self-evident
- These foundational beliefs are indubitable and infallible
- Non-foundational beliefs derive their justification from these foundational beliefs

Coherentism:
- Knowledge is a system of beliefs that cohere with each other
- There are no foundational beliefs
- Justification of a belief depends on its coherence with the entire system of beliefs

Reliabilism:
- Knowledge is justified true belief where the justification comes from a reliable process
- A process is reliable if it generally produces true beliefs
- A belief is justified if it is produced by a reliable process

Evidentialism:
- Knowledge is justified true belief where the justification comes from evidence
- Belief is justified if and only if it is supported by evidence
- The strength of the belief should be proportionate to the strength of the evidence

Externalism:
- Knowledge is justified true belief where the justification does not need to be accessible to the knower
- Justification can come from external factors beyond the knower's awareness
- The knower doesn't need to be aware of the reasons for the justification of the belief

Internalism:
- Knowledge is justified true belief where the justification must be accessible to the knower
- Justification comes from factors within the knower's cognitive perspective
- The knower must be aware of the reasons for the justification of the belief

Virtue Epistemology:
- Knowledge is justified true belief obtained through the exercise of intellectual virtues
- Justification comes from the knower's virtuous intellectual character
- Intellectual virtues are habits that reliably lead to truth

Infinitism:
- Knowledge is justified by an infinite chain of reasons
- Each belief is justified by another belief, and there is no end to this chain
- Justification is not based on foundational beliefs or coherent systems

Fallibilism:
- Knowledge does not require absolute certainty
- Beliefs can be known despite the possibility of being false
- Justification does not require infallibility or indubitability

Contextualism:
- The standards for knowledge vary depending on the context
- What counts as knowledge in one context might not count in another
- Justification standards are context-dependent

Pragmatic Encroachment:
- Practical stakes can affect whether a belief counts as knowledge
- The higher the stakes, the higher the evidential standard for knowledge
- Knowledge is not purely a matter of truth and justification, but also involves practical considerations

Phenomenal Conservatism:
- If it seems to a subject that something is the case, then the subject thereby has at least prima facie justification for believing that it is the case
- Justification is based on how things seem to the subject
- There is no need for further evidence beyond how things seem to justify belief

Epistemic Conservatism:
- Beliefs that are already held have a kind of default justification
- There is a presumption in favor of the truth of a belief that is already held
- A belief is justified until there are sufficient reasons to doubt it
