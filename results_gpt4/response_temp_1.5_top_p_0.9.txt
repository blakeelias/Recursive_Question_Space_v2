Classical Foundationalism:
- Knowledge is a type of mental state
- To know something, a person must hold a belief
- For a belief to qualify as knowledge, it must be justified
- Justification involves the ability to provide a reasonable argument for the belief
- The ultimate justification for all knowledge claims comes from self-evident truths or empirical observations

Reliabilism:
- Knowledge is a belief that is true and formed via a reliable method
- For a person to know something, it is necessary for them to have a belief
- To know something, it is necessary for the belief to be true
- The belief must be the result of a reliable process, method or mechanism
- Reliability is judged based on the track record of the process, method or mechanism in question in generating true beliefs

Empiricism:
- Knowledge comes from sensory experience
- To know something, one must have a corresponding sensory experience
- Concepts and knowledge are ultimately grounded in sensory experience
- All justified beliefs about the external world rely on evidence that comes from the senses

Rationalism:
- Some knowledge can be gained independently of sensory experience
- Reason is the primary source of knowledge
- Knowledge of truths about abstract concepts or truths of logic are independent of sensory experience
- These kinds of knowledge can be achieved through intuition and deduction alone

Pragmatism:
- Knowledge is validated by its practical consequences
- To know something, the belief must be useful or beneficial in some practical way
- Knowledge should not be separated from its practical application and consequences
- Theories are validated by how well they solve problems or answer questions

Coherentism:
- Knowledge is a coherent set of beliefs
- To know something, it must cohere with the rest of one's beliefs
- Knowledge is not justified by a foundation of self-evident truths or sensory observations
- Justification is a matter of a belief's coherence with a larger system of beliefs

Evidentialism:
- To know something, it is necessary to have adequate evidence for it
- The justification of a belief is determined by the quality of evidence for it
- Having knowledge means having a belief backed by adequate evidence
- If there is no evidence to support a belief, it does not constitute knowledge

Internalism:
- The factors that determine whether a belief counts as knowledge are internal to the believer
- To know something, the person must have some kind of conscious access or awareness of their reasons for the belief
- The factors justifying belief can be accessed through introspection

Externalism:
- The factors that make a belief count as knowledge can be external to the believer
- To know something, it is not necessary for the person to be consciously aware of the reasons for the belief
- It's enough if the belief is formed in the right kind of way, even if the person doesn't understand why the process is reliable
