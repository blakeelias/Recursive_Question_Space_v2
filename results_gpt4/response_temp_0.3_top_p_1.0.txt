Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process, and the proposition is true

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is not based on any false assumptions
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is not based on any false assumptions, and the proposition is true

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is causally connected to the truth of the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is causally connected to the truth of the proposition, and the proposition is true

Defeasibility Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there are no defeating conditions that would undermine the justification of the belief
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, there are no defeating conditions that would undermine the justification of the belief, and the proposition is true

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs, and the proposition is true

Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is useful or beneficial in some practical way
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is useful or beneficial in some practical way, and the proposition is true

Contextualist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the standards for knowledge are met in the relevant context
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the standards for knowledge are met in the relevant context, and the proposition is true
