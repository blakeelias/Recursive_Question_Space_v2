Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that their belief in the proposition is produced by a reliable cognitive process
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, their belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process, and the proposition is true

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that no false propositions are used in the reasoning that led to the belief
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and no false propositions are used in the reasoning that led to the belief

Sensitivity Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that if the proposition were false, they would not believe it
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and if the proposition were false, they would not believe it

Safety Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that in most nearby possible worlds where they believe the proposition, the proposition is true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and in most nearby possible worlds where they believe the proposition, the proposition is true

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief in the proposition is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the proposition is true, and the belief in the proposition is causally connected to the fact that makes the proposition true

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief in the proposition coheres with the rest of their beliefs
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief in the proposition coheres with the rest of their beliefs, and the proposition is true

Pragmatic Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief in the proposition leads to successful action
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief in the proposition leads to successful action, and the proposition is true
