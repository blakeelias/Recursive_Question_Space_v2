- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition and the proposition is true

Reliabilist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is produced by a reliable cognitive process, and the proposition is true

No-False-Lemma Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the justification does not rely on any false beliefs
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and the justification does not rely on any false beliefs

Causal Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is caused by the truth of the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief is caused by the truth of the proposition, and the proposition is true

Defeasibility Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that there are no defeating conditions that would undermine the justification
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and there are no defeating conditions that would undermine the justification

Coherentist Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, the belief coheres with the rest of their beliefs, and the proposition is true

- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the standards for knowledge are met in the relevant context
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, the proposition is true, and the standards for knowledge are met in the relevant context

Virtue Epistemology Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that the belief is the result of an intellectual virtue
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
