Classical Tripartite Theory of Knowledge:
- For a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they believe the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary that they have justification for believing the proposition
- for a person to know a proposition, it is necessary for the proposition to be true
- for a person to know a proposition, it is sufficient that they believe the proposition, have justification for believing the proposition, and the proposition is true

Reliabilism Theory of Knowledge:
- A person's belief counts as knowledge if it has been produced by a reliable process
- Reliable processes are more likely than not to produce true beliefs
- A reliable process does not require the conscious understanding of why the process is reliable by the person

Evidentialism Theory of Knowledge:
- It is necessary for a person to have evidence for a belief to count as knowledge
- The strength of evidence required for knowledge is proportionate to the strength of the belief
- The evidence must be accessible consciously to the believer

Coherentism Theory of Knowledge:
- A belief counts as knowledge if it coheres with the rest of the believer's beliefs
- A belief must not contradict other beliefs from the same belief system
- In this belief system, there are no foundation beliefs, but the beliefs support each other in a unified structure

Externalism Theory of Knowledge:
- A belief can count as knowledge even if its justification is not consciously accessible to the believer
- The reliability of the belief formation process matters more than the believer's insights
- The external factors contributing to belief formation are more critical than the believerâ€™s internal psychological states

Internalism Theory of Knowledge:
- All the factors needed to justify a belief as knowledge must be internally accessible
- The individual must be capable of introspecting all the required evidences or reasons
- The psychological state of the believer plays a critical role in determining whether belief counts as knowledge

Contextualism Theory of Knowledge:
- What counts as knowledge depends on the context
- The standards of justification for a belief being knowledge vary depending on the situation
- Various elements of the situation, like conversational context, are important in determining knowledge

Pragmatical Theory of Knowledge:
- A belief counts as knowledge if it produces useful results
- Belief that leads to successful action can be considered knowledge
- Usefulness of belief is more critical than its metaphysical correspondence with truth

Fallibilism theory of Knowledge:
- Knowledge does not require absolute certainty
- It is possible to know something even if it is conceivable that what you know could be proven false
- Infallibility is not a necessary condition for knowledge

Infinitism Theory of Knowledge:
- Justification of a belief depends on an infinite chain of reasons
- Every reason used for justifying needs its own justification
- Justifications should not assume unjustified foundation beliefs or circular reasoning
