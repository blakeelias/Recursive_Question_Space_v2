It maintains that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must be true, the individual must believe it, and there must be sufficient justification for that belief, which is often rooted in personal inquiry and critical thinking. Knowledge is thus constructed through the rigorous application of logic, empirical evidence, and the careful assessment of arguments by individuals independently, rather than being shaped primarily by social consensus. The commitment to rational inquiry places the onus on the individual to engage in thoughtful examination and evaluation of beliefs, creating a standard for knowledge that does not solely depend on communal agreement or social validation.",

Individuals are encouraged to adopt a skeptical approach, questioning assumptions and rigorously testing claims against evidence. Knowledge is thus seen as being established through personal verification, where beliefs must withstand challenges and undergo processes of falsification and confirmation.
